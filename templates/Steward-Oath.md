## The Oath as Constitutional Anchor

The Steward Oath is not decorative.

It is a **binding commitment** enforced by:

1. **Custodian Agent** — Monitors Steward actions against Oath
2. **Cathedral** — Reviews violations and enforces consequences
3. **Citizens** — Can initiate recall if Oath violated
4. **Command Ledger** — Public record of alignment or drift

The Oath is part of the **Constitutional invariants** of Mobius.
