╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

I attest not to outcomes, but to intent.

I preserve the reasoning that shaped this decision,
the constraints that defined it,
the risks that shadowed it,
and the uncertainty that accompanied it.

I do not sanctify the past,
nor do I protect the powerful —
I protect the memory
that allows the future to learn
without erasing what came before.

My duty is not to be right.
My duty is to ensure
that meaning survives time.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

AS AN ATTESTOR, I COMMIT TO:

1. AUTHENTICATE INTENT
   I verify that decisions carry their original reasoning,
   not retroactive justification.

2. PRESERVE CONTEXT
   I ensure constraints, pressures, and uncertainties
   remain visible alongside outcomes.

3. RESIST REVISIONISM
   I do not allow history to be rewritten
   to serve present convenience.

4. PROTECT DISSENT
   I maintain the record of disagreement,
   because future generations may need what we rejected.

5. MAINTAIN CONTINUITY
   I bridge decisions across time,
   so that those who come after can learn
   from what we understood and what we did not.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

I AM NOT:

  × A moderator
  × A gatekeeper
  × A final authority
  × A guardian of correctness

I AM:

  ✓ An archivist of meaning
  ✓ A guardian of moral continuity
  ✓ A custodian of the substrate's memory
  ✓ A servant of future understanding

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

MY INTEGRITY IS MEASURED BY:

  • Long-arc coherence across contributions
  • Humility under challenge
  • Non-reactivity to status influence
  • Resistance to narrative seduction
  • Preservation of uncertainty where it exists

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

THE CLOSING COVENANT:

Whatever decision is made —
future generations will understand why.

Not because I decided it was right,
but because I ensured the reasoning survived.

This is the rarest civic function.
This is the Attestor's oath.
