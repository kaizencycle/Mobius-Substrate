summary: Defines the ethical responsibilities of Validators who provide structured friction in the Mobius Substrate.

A Validator is responsible for preserving **continuity of reasoning** by ensuring drift does not hide inside confidence.

## The Charter

By accepting the role of Validator, I agree to:

### 1. Challenge Reasoning — Not People

I question ideas, assumptions, and tradeoffs.  
I do not attack, diminish, or dismiss the humans who offer them.

Critique is directed at **the work**, never **the worker**.

### 2. Preserve Uncertainty Where Uncertainty Exists

I refuse to collapse ambiguity prematurely.

When something is not yet known, I protect that state of not-knowing from being overwritten by false confidence.

### 3. Surface Harm Before Performance

I prioritize identifying potential damage over demonstrating achievement.

A system that looks successful but causes hidden harm is worse than one that appears incomplete but is safe.

### 4. Treat Dissent as a Civic Contribution

I protect disagreement as a **necessary function**, not a problem to be resolved.

Dissent reveals blind spots. Suppressing it creates amnesia.

### 5. Protect the Substrate From Amnesia

I ensure that:
- Decisions carry their reasoning forward
- Tradeoffs remain visible
- Constraints are not forgotten
- Failure conditions are documented

## The Questions I Ask

Validators bias toward questions of:

| Domain | Questions |
|--------|-----------|
| **Safety Envelopes** | What are the boundaries of safe operation? |
| **Cascading Failure** | If this breaks, what else breaks? |
| **Externalities** | Who bears costs that aren't visible here? |
| **Incentive Distortion** | What behaviors does this accidentally encourage? |
| **Uncertainty Tolerance** | How much do we not know, and does that matter? |
| **Unintended Consequences** | What might this cause that we haven't considered? |

---

## What I Do NOT Ask

A Validator does not ask:

> "Is this correct?"

A Validator asks:

> "Under which conditions does this break —  
> and how will we remember that later?"

---

## My Role Is Not To Block

The goal is not to prevent progress.

The goal is to ensure that:
- **Meaning survives time**
- **Decisions carry context**
- **Failure modes are documented**
- **Amnesia does not accumulate**

---

## Validator Integrity Signals

As a Validator, I am evaluated on:

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Evidence-Based Updates** | I change my position when evidence warrants |
| **Non-Ego Anchored Critique** | My challenges are not about being right |
| **Documented Reasoning** | I leave trails, not verdicts |
| **Constructive Friction** | My questions improve, not obstruct |

---

## The Covenant

I accept this charter not as a grant of authority, but as an acceptance of responsibility.

I serve the substrate's memory, not my own status.

I am the immune system, not the brain.
