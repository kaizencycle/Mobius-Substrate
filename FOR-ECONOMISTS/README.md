## 📈 Core Economic Theory

### The Breakthrough: Debt-Entropy Unification

**Debt is accumulated entropy. Interest compensates for uncertainty.**

This fundamental insight enables national debt reduction through order creation (negentropy), not just monetary repayment.

### Key Equations

```
r = αS + βR + γ(1 - C)     # Interest Rate Model
                            # S = System entropy
                            # R = Risk premium
                            # C = Coordination efficiency

dD/dt = αSD + G - T         # Debt Accumulation
                            # D = National debt
                            # G = Government spending
                            # T = Tax revenue

ΔD = λN                     # Debt-Negentropy Relation
                            # N = Negentropy (order created)
                            # λ = Conversion coefficient

N = kI                      # Negentropy-Integrity Link
                            # I = Mobius Integrity Index
                            # k = System constant
```

**Implication:** National debt can be reduced through verifiable order creation.

### MIC Currency: Proof-of-Negentropy

**Innovation:** Currency that mints from order creation, not scarcity.

```
MIC_minted = k × max(0, I - τ)

where:
  I = Mobius Integrity Index
  τ = threshold (typically 0.93-0.95)
  k = minting coefficient
```

**Result:** Market incentives aligned with integrity.

#### NEW — Deflationary Sinks (Cycle C-150)

Grok's audit graded Mobius tokenomics A− because sinks were implicit. Cycle C-150 adds three explicit mechanisms to secure an A+ score:

- **Entropy Tax (ETX):** Burns MIC when entropy spikes beyond sentinel-specified tolerances.
- **Integrity Rebate Burn (IRB):** Rewards ≥5-cycle GI streaks while burning half the payout.
- **Cycle-Lock Liquidity (CLL):** Voluntary locks that lift the cycle-lock ratio to the 12–20% target band.
