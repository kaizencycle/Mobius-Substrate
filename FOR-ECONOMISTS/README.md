## 📈 Core Economic Theory

### The Breakthrough: Debt-Entropy Unification

**Debt is accumulated entropy. Interest compensates for uncertainty.**

This fundamental insight enables national debt reduction through order creation (negentropy), not just monetary repayment.

### Key Equations

```
r = αS + βR + γ(1 - C)     # Interest Rate Model
                            # S = System entropy
                            # R = Risk premium
                            # C = Coordination efficiency

dD/dt = αSD + G - T         # Debt Accumulation
                            # D = National debt
                            # G = Government spending
                            # T = Tax revenue

ΔD = λN                     # Debt-Negentropy Relation
                            # N = Negentropy (order created)
                            # λ = Conversion coefficient

N = kI                      # Negentropy-Integrity Link
                            # I = Mobius Integrity Index
                            # k = System constant
```

**Implication:** National debt can be reduced through verifiable order creation.

### MIC Currency: Proof-of-Integrity

**Innovation:** Currency that mints from order creation, not scarcity.

```
ΔMIC = max(0, S × (MII - τ))

where:
  MII = Mobius Integrity Index [0,1]
  τ = threshold (0.95)
  S = sensitivity (1000 MIC per 0.01 MII)
```

**Result:** Market incentives aligned with integrity.

#### 📄 MIC Whitepaper v2.0 (C-155) — Production Specification

The comprehensive MIC specification covering:
- **Proof-of-Integrity (PoI) consensus** — Security purchased with aligned action
- **Kaizen Shards framework** — Seven shard types for micro-attestations
- **Distribution model** — 60% contributors, 25% treasury, 10% sentinels, 5% reserve
- **Anti-plutocratic governance** — Voting power = sqrt(MIC) × Civic Reputation
- **Wicksellian cumulative process** — Civilizational stability as policy target

#### NEW — Deflationary Sinks (Cycle C-150)

Grok's audit graded Mobius tokenomics A− because sinks were implicit. Cycle C-150 adds three explicit mechanisms to secure an A+ score:

- **Entropy Tax (ETX):** Burns MIC when entropy spikes beyond sentinel-specified tolerances.
- **Integrity Rebate Burn (IRB):** Rewards ≥5-cycle GI streaks while burning half the payout.
- **Cycle-Lock Liquidity (CLL):** Voluntary locks that lift the cycle-lock ratio to the 12–20% target band.
