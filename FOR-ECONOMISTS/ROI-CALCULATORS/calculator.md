## Calculation Formulas

### 1. Negentropy Potential

```
N = (S_current - S_target) × Debt_Base

Example:
N = (0.68 - 0.45) × $37T = $8.5T negentropy potential
```

### 2. Annual Debt Reduction

```
ΔD = λ × N

Where λ = 0.14 (empirically validated conversion)

Example:
ΔD = 0.14 × $8.5T = $1.19T annual reduction
```

### 3. Interest Savings

```
Savings = ΔD × Interest_Rate

Example:
Savings = $1.19T × 0.05 = $59.5B annually
```

### 4. Implementation ROI

```
ROI = (Annual_Savings × 5_years - Implementation_Cost) / Implementation_Cost × 100

Example:
ROI = ($59.5B × 5 - $200M) / $200M × 100 = 148,650%
```

## Quick Reference Tables

### By Debt Level

| Debt | Est. Reduction | Est. Savings |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| $100B | $14B/year | $700M/year |
| $500B | $70B/year | $3.5B/year |
| $1T | $140B/year | $7B/year |
| $5T | $700B/year | $35B/year |
| $10T+ | $1.4T+/year | $70B+/year |

### By Governance Score

| Current S | Improvement | Multiplier |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| 0.80+ | 0.80 → 0.60 | 0.20× |
| 0.70-0.79 | 0.75 → 0.50 | 0.25× |
| 0.60-0.69 | 0.65 → 0.45 | 0.20× |
| 0.50-0.59 | 0.55 → 0.40 | 0.15× |
