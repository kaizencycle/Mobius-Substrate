# DVA Flow Templates

Use these templates when creating new flows to ensure consistency and constitutional guardrails.

- `flow_template.json` / `.md` — Minimal scaffold for any new DVA flow
- `sentinel_gateway_template.json` — Baseline for building a Sentinel-protected ingress

Copy, rename, and fill in the TODOs before activating a new flow.
