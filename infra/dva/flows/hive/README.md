# DVA.HIVE Flows — Network Tier

DVA.HIVE coordinates multiple Mobius nodes (cities, organizations, domains) to compute cross-node integrity and publish global attestations.

## Flows

- `dva_hive_consensus_topology.json` — Aggregates GI per node and builds network view
- `dva_hive_global_attestation.json` — Publishes global state summaries to the Civic Ledger
- `.md` files — Describe responsibilities and safety rules for each flow
