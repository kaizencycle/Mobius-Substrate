# DVA.ONE Flows — Feedback & Learning Tier

DVA.ONE turns human overrides into structured signals so Sentinels and policies can evolve safely. It consists of:

- `dva_one_feedback.json` — Webhook that captures human review outcomes
- `dva_one_learning_loop.json` — Nightly analysis that proposes adjustments
- Companion `.md` files explaining the governance contract

DVA.ONE never auto-modifies thresholds; it only records and proposes.
