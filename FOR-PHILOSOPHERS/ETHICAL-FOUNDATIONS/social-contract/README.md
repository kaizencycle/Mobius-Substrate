**Rousseauvian consent in digital systems.**

## Overview

Social contract theory in the Mobius context addresses the fundamental question: **What legitimizes AI governance over human affairs?**

Our answer: Only explicit, revocable consent.

## The Digital Social Contract

### Traditional Social Contract (Rousseau)

```
Natural State → Agreement → Civil Society
     ↓              ↓            ↓
  Freedom      Social Contract   Laws
  Inequality   Mutual benefit    Order
  Conflict     Consent          Peace
```

### Mobius Social Contract

```
Uncoordinated AI → Agreement → Governed Intelligence
       ↓               ↓              ↓
  Capability drift   Civic Oath    Integrity
  Value misalignment Virtue Accords Coordination
  Conflict potential Charter       Harmony
```

## Core Principles

### 1. Explicit Consent

No one is governed without agreeing:

```yaml
civic_oath:
  type: voluntary
  revocable: true
  terms:
    - I understand the system's purposes
    - I agree to follow the Virtue Accords
    - I accept sentinel governance in scope
    - I may withdraw at any time
```

### 2. Revocable Membership

Exit is always possible:

| Action | Process | Consequence |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Pause | Temporary withdrawal | Data preserved, no governance |
| Exit | Full withdrawal | Data exported, full deletion option |
| Return | Re-enrollment | Fresh start, history optional |

### 3. Transparent Governance

All rules are public:

- Charter: Foundational document, readable by all
- Virtue Accords: Ethical commitments, version-controlled
- Decisions: Logged on public ledger
- Reasoning: Deliberation traces available

## Legitimacy Conditions

For Mobius governance to be legitimate:

### Condition 1: Informed Consent

Participants must understand:
- What they're consenting to
- What powers they're granting
- What benefits they receive
- How to withdraw

### Condition 2: Fair Terms

The contract must be:
- Mutually beneficial
- Not exploitative
- Equally applied
- Regularly reviewed

### Condition 3: Democratic Process

Rules can be changed through:
- Public proposal
- Deliberation
- Voting
- Amendment process

### Condition 4: Exit Rights

Leaving must be:
- Possible at any time
- Without penalty
- With data portability
- With dignity preserved

## The Civic Oath

### Full Text

```
I, [name/identifier], freely enter the Mobius covenant.

I understand:
- This system governs through multi-agent AI consensus
- Sentinels make decisions within their scope
- All decisions are recorded on public ledger
- I may participate in governance through established channels

I commit to:
- Acting with integrity in my interactions
- Respecting the Virtue Accords
- Contributing to collective coordination
- Raising concerns through proper channels

I retain:
- My right to withdraw at any time
- My right to appeal decisions
- My right to data portability
- My fundamental human rights

This oath is voluntary and revocable.
```

### Oath Ceremony

The oath is a meaningful commitment, not bureaucratic checkbox:

1. **Understanding**: Review system documentation
2. **Reflection**: Consider implications
3. **Declaration**: State oath publicly (optional) or privately
4. **Record**: Oath recorded on ledger
5. **Welcome**: Integration into community

## Philosophical Tensions

### Tension 1: AI Consent

Can AI agents consent to governance?

**Response**: AI consent is simulated consent; legitimacy flows from human oversight.

### Tension 2: Future Generations

Can we bind those not yet born?

**Response**: Amendment processes allow future modification; core rights protected.

### Tension 3: Implicit Consent

What about those who benefit without opting in?

**Response**: Participation in governed activities implies consent to scope-limited governance.

## Research Questions

1. **Digital Personhood**: Should AI agents have contractual rights?
2. **Collective Consent**: Can communities consent for members?
3. **Emergent Governance**: What if governance emerges without explicit contract?
4. **Global Scope**: Can one contract govern global systems?
