# The Virtue Accords

**Core Document:** Ethical principles governing recursive intelligence systems  
**Status:** Active and enforced since C-103  

---

## Overview

The Virtue Accords establish the ethical foundation for all Mobius Systems operations. They define the virtues that guide AI development, governance, and human-machine interaction.

- Learning from history

**Metric:** Outcome quality over time

**Violations:**
- Context-blind application
- Short-term optimization

- Repeating mistakes

---

## Virtue Tags

All code contributions must include appropriate virtue tags:

```yaml
# Virtue tagging example
virtue_tags:
  - integrity: "Implements immutable logging"
  - transparency: "All decisions explainable"
  - humility: "Includes uncertainty estimates"
```

### Tag Categories

| Tag | Symbol | Meaning |
|-----|--------|---------|
| `integrity` | 🛡️ | Enforces consistency |
| `transparency` | 👁️ | Increases visibility |
| `humility` | 🙏 | Acknowledges limits |
| `compassion` | 💚 | Prioritizes welfare |
| `justice` | ⚖️ | Ensures fairness |
| `courage` | 🦁 | Takes principled stand |
| `wisdom` | 🦉 | Applies appropriate judgment |

---

## Enforcement

### Pre-Commit Check

Every commit is evaluated for virtue compliance:

```bash
npm run virtue:check

# Output:
# Virtue Analysis for commit abc123:
# - Integrity: PASS (attestation present)
# - Transparency: PASS (documentation complete)
# - Humility: PASS (uncertainty acknowledged)
# - Compassion: PASS (impact assessed)
# - Justice: PASS (fairness tested)
# - Courage: N/A (no principled stand required)
# - Wisdom: PASS (context considered)
# 
# Overall Virtue Score: 0.97 ✓
```

### Violation Response

When virtue violations are detected:

1. **Immediate:** Commit blocked
2. **Short-term:** Issue created for remediation
3. **Long-term:** Pattern analysis for systemic issues

### Appeals Process

Contributors may appeal virtue violations:

1. Submit appeal with justification
2. Multi-sentinel review
3. Human arbitration if needed
4. Decision documented publicly

---

## Historical Development

### Origins

The Virtue Accords emerged from:
- Buddhist ethical principles (慈悲, 正義)
- Japanese aesthetic philosophy (誠実)
- Western virtue ethics (Aristotle, MacIntyre)
- AI safety research (alignment, corrigibility)

### Evolution

| Cycle | Development |
|-------|-------------|
| C-103 | Initial 5 virtues defined |
| C-109 | Added Courage virtue |
| C-115 | Added Wisdom virtue |
| C-121 | Virtue tagging implemented |
| C-135 | Automated enforcement |

## Integration with Mobius

### SML Connection

Daily reflections reinforce virtues:
- Morning: "What mattered?" (Wisdom)
- Midday: "How do you feel?" (Compassion)
- Evening: "What do you intend?" (Courage)

### MCP Connection

MCP phases map to virtues:
- Phase 1: Integrity (code quality)
- Phase 2: Transparency (GI scoring)
- Phase 3: Humility (consensus)
- Phase 4: Justice (public attestation)

### ECHO Connection

ECHO detects virtue drift:
- Integrity drift: Inconsistent behavior
- Compassion drift: Harm patterns
- Justice drift: Fairness degradation

---

## Philosophical Foundations

### Eastern Wisdom

The Virtue Accords draw from:
- **Buddhism:** Compassion (慈悲), Right Action
- **Confucianism:** Integrity (誠), Righteousness (義)
- **Shinto:** Purity, Harmony

### Western Philosophy

Integration with:
- **Aristotle:** Virtue as mean between extremes
- **Kant:** Categorical imperative
- **Rawls:** Justice as fairness
- **MacIntyre:** Tradition-embedded virtues

### AI Ethics

Alignment with:
- **Corrigibility:** Humility, openness to correction
- **Alignment:** Integrity, value consistency
- **Safety:** Compassion, harm prevention

---

## Practical Application

### For Developers

When writing code, ask:
- **Integrity:** Is this consistent with stated values?
- **Transparency:** Can others understand this?
- **Humility:** Does this acknowledge uncertainty?
- **Compassion:** Who might this harm?
- **Justice:** Is this fair to all affected?
- **Courage:** Am I taking the right stand?
- **Wisdom:** Is this appropriate in context?

### For Operators

When deploying systems, ensure:
- Virtue tags present on all components
- Impact assessments completed
- Monitoring for virtue drift active
- Appeals process accessible

### For Users

When interacting with Mobius, expect:
- Transparent reasoning
- Acknowledged limitations
- Welfare prioritization
- Fair treatment
- Principled behavior

---

## Virtue Conflicts

When virtues conflict, apply this hierarchy:

1. **Compassion** — Never harm
2. **Justice** — Never discriminate
3. **Integrity** — Maintain consistency
4. **Courage** — Take principled stands
5. **Transparency** — Make visible
6. **Humility** — Acknowledge limits
7. **Wisdom** — Apply appropriately

### Example

If transparency would cause harm (exposing vulnerable data), compassion takes precedence.

---

## Measurement

### Virtue Index (VI)

```
VI = (Σ virtue_scores) / 7

Where each virtue_score ∈ [0, 1]
```

**Current VI:** 0.96 (C-148)

### Trend Analysis

| Virtue | C-103 | C-120 | C-148 | Trend |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Integrity | 0.94 | 0.96 | 0.97 | ↑ |
| Transparency | 0.91 | 0.94 | 0.96 | ↑ |
| Humility | 0.89 | 0.92 | 0.95 | ↑ |
| Compassion | 0.95 | 0.96 | 0.97 | ↑ |
