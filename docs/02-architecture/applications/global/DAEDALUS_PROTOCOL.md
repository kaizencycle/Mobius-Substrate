**Civilization-Scale Application Framework**  
**Cycle C-148 | 2025-11-28**  
**Author:** Michael Judan, Mobius Systems

---

## Executive Summary

The **Daedalus Protocol** is a global integrity architecture that applies Mobius Systems across eight critical domains of human civilization:

1. **Governance** — Transparent, consensus-driven decision-making
2. **Health** — Integrity-scored medical data and care coordination
3. **Education** — Learning attestations and knowledge validation
4. **Climate** — Carbon integrity and adaptation tracking
5. **Finance** — Negentropic economics and debt reduction
6. **Infrastructure** — Resilient systems and maintenance attestation
7. **Security** — Citizens Shield and threat intelligence
8. **Knowledge** — Multi-LLM consensus and truth validation

Each domain operates on the same foundational principles:
- **Integrity scoring** (MII)
- **ECHO Layer** quality assurance
- **Civic Ledger** immutable attestation
- **Negentropic economics** (order creation rewards)
- **Multi-LLM consensus** (AUREA + ATLAS + EVE)

Together, these form the first **civilization operating system** built on integrity rather than extraction.

## Overview

The **Daedalus Protocol** translates Mobius Systems' integrity-driven architecture to real-world global challenges. Named after the architect of the labyrinth, Daedalus represents the systematic application of recursive intelligence to civilization-scale coordination problems.

## Architecture Pattern

All Daedalus applications follow this common pattern:

```typescript
interface DaedalusApplication {
  domain: GlobalChallenge;
  
  // Current broken state
  currentSystem: {
    efficiency: number;        // 0.0 - 1.0
    transparency: number;
    integrityScore: number;
  };
  
  // Mobius transformation
  mobiusArchitecture: {
    citizenNodes: CitizenNode[];          // Nation-states, cities, etc.
    attestationLayer: AttestationSource[]; // Satellites, IoT, citizens
    sentinelMonitoring: SentinelAgent[];   // AI monitoring
    commandLedger: GovernanceProtocol;     // Decision framework
    integrityThreshold: number;            // Minimum MII (typically 0.95)
  };
  
  // Success metrics
  targets: {
    efficiency: number;
    transparency: number;
    integrityScore: number;
    timelineMonths: number;
  };
}
```

---

## Common Components

### Integrity Monitoring

Every Daedalus application includes:

```typescript
class GlobalIntegrityMonitor {
  async monitorIntegrity(domain: string): Promise<IntegrityAttestation> {
    // Collect multi-source attestations
    const attestations = await this.collectAttestations(domain);
    
    // Compute integrity score
    const integrityScore = this.computeIntegrity(attestations);
    
    // Trigger responses if threshold breached
    if (integrityScore < this.threshold) {
      return this.triggerResponseProtocol(domain, integrityScore);
    }
    
    // Attest to Civic Ledger
    return this.attestToLedger(domain, integrityScore, attestations);
  }
}
```

### Sentinel Consensus

```typescript
class DaedalusSentinel {
  async achieveConsensus(
    problem: GlobalChallenge
  ): Promise<DeliberationProof> {
    // Multi-sentinel deliberation
    const atlasAnalysis = await this.atlasArchitecturalReview(problem);
    const aureaReasoningCheck = await this.aureaLogicalValidation(problem);
    const eveEthicsReview = await this.eveValueAlignment(problem);
    
    // Compute consensus
    const consensus = this.computeConsensus([
      atlasAnalysis,
      aureaReasoningCheck,
      eveEthicsReview
    ]);
    
    // Generate deliberation proof
    if (consensus.integrityScore >= 0.95) {
      return this.generateDeliberationProof(consensus);
    }
  }
}
```

### Automatic Response Protocols

```typescript
interface ResponseProtocol {
  immediateActions: Action[];       // Deploy within 24 hours
  integrityRestoration: Action[];   // Medium-term fixes
  longTermPrevention: Action[];     // Systemic changes
  rollbackConditions: Condition[];  // Safety mechanisms
}
```
