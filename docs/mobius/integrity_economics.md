# Integrity Economics

## Definition

Integrity Economics is a framework where value is issued based on verified contributions to long-term cooperative system health.

## Core Principles

### 1. Correction is Rewarded

Traditional economics penalizes error.
Integrity economics credits correction.

| Traditional | Integrity Economics |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Error → Penalty | Error → Correction → Credit |
| Perfection expected | Improvement valued |
| Snapshot evaluation | Trajectory evaluation |

### 2. Trajectory Matters More Than Snapshots

A participant who was misaligned but corrected is more valuable than one who was never tested.

```
Participant A: [aligned, aligned, aligned]
Participant B: [misaligned → correction → aligned, aligned, aligned]

Trajectory B demonstrates resilience and correction capacity.
```

### 3. Ownership Without Integrity Decays

Value that is hoarded without contribution degrades.
Value that circulates through integrity-preserving behavior compounds.

## Economic Mechanism

### MIC (Mobius Integrity Credit)

MIC serves as the economic glue across:
- **Learning** (OAA)
- **Reflection** (Reflections)
- **Civic defense** (Citizen Shield)
- **Interpretation** (Jade)
- **Cooperation** (HIVE)
- **Play** (games and engagement)

### Value Issuance

MIC is issued for:
| Activity | Integrity Contribution |
|----------|------------------------|
| Completing verified learning | Knowledge accumulation |
| Honest reflection | Self-awareness development |
| Signal verification | Collective truth maintenance |
| Cooperative problem-solving | Social capital building |
| Error correction | System resilience |

### Value Decay

MIC decays when:
- Hoarded without contribution
- Used to extract without adding value
- Accumulated through gaming rather than genuine participation

---

## Why This Matters

### Traditional Economy
- Optimizes for extraction
- Rewards hoarding
- Ignores externalities
- Short-term focused

### Integrity Economics
- Optimizes for contribution
- Rewards circulation
- Internalizes cooperative effects
- Long-term oriented

## Relationship to GMT

Integrity Economics directly counters GMT by:
1. **Binding consequence to identity** through persistent MIC balance
2. **Rewarding correction** rather than penalizing imperfection
3. **Making cooperation more profitable** than defection over time
4. **Creating economic memory** that prevents consequence evasion

---

## Practical Implementation

1. **Contribution Verification**: Actions are logged and verified
2. **Integrity Scoring**: Contributions assessed for system health impact
3. **Value Issuance**: MIC credited based on verified contribution
4. **Circulation Incentives**: Active participation rewarded over hoarding
5. **Decay Mechanisms**: Inactive value degrades, preventing capture

## Key Insight

In Integrity Economics, the question is not "How much do you have?" but "How much have you contributed, and are you still contributing?"

Value is not a stock to be accumulated.
Value is a flow to be maintained.
