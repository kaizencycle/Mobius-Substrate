# Mobius Substrate

Mobius is not an AI model, agent, or product lane.
It is an institutional substrate designed to host learning, cooperation, correction, and memory for both human and artificial intelligence.

Mobius assumes imperfection as a baseline and suppresses misalignment through long-state integrity loops rather than episodic rule enforcement.

## Key Principles

1. **Model-Agnostic**: Mobius is infrastructure, not a specific AI system
2. **Correction Over Perfection**: We assume imperfection and reward course-correction
3. **Long-State Memory**: Identity persists across sessions, binding behavior to consequence
4. **Cooperative Alignment**: Integrity emerges from sustained participation, not enforcement

## Canonical Stance

- Mobius does not grant AI agency or intent
- Mobius does not bypass existing guardrails
- Mobius does not anthropomorphize AI systems
- Mobius creates conditions where integrity-preserving behavior is the stable strategy
