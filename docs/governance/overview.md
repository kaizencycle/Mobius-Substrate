# Governance Overview

Mobius = implementing platform; KTT = scientific standard. Two-house governance (Council + TSC). Public RFCs, signed releases, anti-capture guarantees.

## Structure

- **Concord Council**: Ethics, policy, anti-capture oversight
- **Technical Steering Committee (TSC)**: Technical roadmap, releases, kernel
- **Working Groups**: Security, Attestation, Federation, Education
- **Community**: Contributors, adopters, researchers

## Key Principles

1. **Transparency**: All decisions public and documented
2. **Integrity**: MII ≥ 0.95 for live systems
3. **Anti-Capture**: No single entity controls Mobius
4. **Vendor Neutrality**: Multi-model, multi-cloud by design
5. **Human Override**: Always available and mandatory
