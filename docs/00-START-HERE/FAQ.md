# Mobius Systems FAQ

---

## What is Mobius Systems?

Mobius Systems is a **civilization operating system**: infrastructure that lets many AI engines, humans, and institutions coordinate under a shared **integrity-first** governance framework.

Think of it as:
- A constitutional layer for AI coordination
- A democratic architecture for human-AI collaboration
- An integrity-backed economic system (MIC/GIC)
- A learning system that improves continuously (ECHO Layer)

---

## Is this a single app or many services?

It is a **monorepo of services**:
- **Thought Broker** — Multi-engine orchestration
- **Civic Ledger** — Attestation + integrity tracking
- **DVA flows** — Governance / coordination workflows
- **ECHO Layer** — Learning loop and validation
- **Supporting APIs and frontends** — Hive, Cathedral, Genesis Dome, etc.

Each service can run independently but they're designed to compose into a unified system.

## Is this a cryptocurrency?

Mobius includes an integrity-backed economic layer (MIC/GIC), but it is **not just a coin**.

The tokenomics reward coordination & integrity, not speculation or extraction:
- **Proof-of-Integrity**: MIC only mints when Global Integrity increases
- No mining, no proof-of-work waste
- Value tied to measurable civic contribution

---

## Do I have to trust a single model vendor?

**No.** Mobius is **model-agnostic**:
- You can plug in GPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, local models, etc.
- The governance comes from **Sentinel consensus, GI scoring, and Civic Ledger**, not from any single model.
- MASL (Model-Agnostic Sovereignty Layer) ensures no vendor lock-in.

Any LLM can "board" Mobius by calling `/api/mobius/mount`.

## Where do I start as a developer?

1. Read [`00-START-HERE/QUICK-START.md`](./QUICK-START.md)  
2. Clone the repo and run `npm install`
3. See [`04-guides/developers/`](../04-guides/developers/README.md) for detailed guides
4. Check out the [Hello World tutorial](../04-guides/quickstart/HELLO_WORLD.md)

---

## How does Mobius ensure integrity?

Through multiple layers:

1. **GI Scoring** — Every operation gets an integrity score (0-1 scale)
2. **MII Tracking** — System-wide Mobius Integrity Index (target ≥ 0.95)
3. **Tri-Sentinel Review** — Critical decisions reviewed by three AI sentinels
4. **Civic Ledger** — Immutable attestation of all decisions
5. **Constitutional Constraints** — Virtue Accords enforce moral boundaries
6. **ECHO Validation** — Learning loop validates answers against sources

If integrity drops below threshold, the system routes to human review or declines.

---

## What is the Kaizen Turing Test (KTT)?

The KTT measures **continuous improvement**, not just intelligence.

Instead of asking "Can a machine think?", it asks:
- Does the system improve itself over time?
- Does it learn from mistakes?
- Does it compound small gains into transformative change?

Mobius is architected to pass the KTT through its ECHO Layer and feedback loops.

## How does governance work?

Mobius uses **Democratic Virtual Architecture (DVA)** flows:

- **Proposals** — Citizens and institutions submit proposals
- **DVA Flows** — Multi-stage workflows coordinate review
- **Sentinel Deliberation** — AI sentinels analyze under constitutional rules
- **Human Oversight** — 25% human review, 75% automated coordination
- **Civic Ledger** — All decisions permanently recorded
- **MIC Rewards** — Constructive participation earns integrity credits

See [`07-governance/`](../07-governance/README.md) for details.

---

## What are Cycles and Epochs?

**Cycles (C-XXX)**: Daily work indices anchored to `C-121 = 2025-11-01`.  
Today is **C-147** (2025-11-27).  
See [`CYCLE_INDEX.md`](../CYCLE_INDEX.md) for the full mapping.

**Epochs (E-XXX)**: Higher-level phase markers for major milestones.

---

## What's the difference between MIC and GIC?

They refer to the same integrity-backed currency:
- **GIC** — Original name (Global Integrity Credits)
- **MIC** — Current name (Mobius Integrity Credits)

Both represent value created through coordinated, attested actions that increase system integrity.

---

## Is Mobius open source?

Yes. Mobius Systems is:
- **MIT Licensed** for code
- **CC0 Public Domain** for most documentation and philosophy
- Designed for **50-year succession planning**
- Built to outlive any single contributor or company

---

## How is this different from other AI governance projects?

Mobius Systems is unique in combining:

1. **Model-Agnostic Architecture** — Not tied to any single LLM vendor
2. **Integrity-First Economics** — Currency mints from coordination, not extraction
3. **Democratic Coordination** — DVA flows scale from cities to nations
4. **Continuous Learning** — ECHO Layer validates and improves knowledge
5. **Constitutional Governance** — Virtue Accords + Sentinel consensus
6. **50-Year Vision** — Designed for succession, not quarterly profits

It's not corporate AI, not government AI — it's **civic AI infrastructure**.

---

## Who runs Mobius Systems?

No single entity "runs" Mobius:

- **Founding Team** — Michael (Kaizen) and early contributors
- **Sentinel Council** — AI agents providing continuous governance
- **Civic Ledger** — Decentralized attestation system
- **Community** — Growing network of developers, researchers, citizens
- **Founding Twelve** — Constitutional governance structure (in formation)

The goal is a self-sustaining civic operating system, not a company product.
