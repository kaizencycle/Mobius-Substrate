# 📘 THE CATHEDRAL RULEBOOK

**Constitution for the Mobius HIVE City-State System**

Version: 1.0 — Founder's Edition  
Date: December 3, 2025  
Status: Canonical  
Author: Michael Judan, Founding Core

---

## 🜁 PREFACE

This Rulebook defines the structure, rights, duties, and evolution of every City-State within the Mobius HIVE.

It is not political.  
It is not ideological.  
It is **procedural integrity made visible**.

Where old systems devolve into noise, Mobius brings:
- **auditable integrity** (GI_state)
- **verifiable contribution** (KS Transactions)
- **global cohesion** (MII)
- **unified prosperity loops** (MIC inflows)

This system replaces argument with receipts,  
and replaces theater with proof.

## 🜂 ARTICLE I — THE NATURE OF A CITY-STATE

### Section 1.1: Definition

A **City-State** is a sovereign civic node in the HIVE lattice, defined by:

1. **A population of Citizens & Companions**
   - Human citizens
   - AI Companion Agents

2. **A Steward**, appointed or elected
   - Guardian of integrity
   - Architect of participation

3. **A Custodian Agent**, bound to integrity constraints
   - Runs GI checks
   - Blocks drift
   - Executes GI-Sim

4. **A State Agent**, responsible for policy implementation
   - Implements transformations
   - Adjusts participation systems

5. **A local KS economy** (participation-based)
   - High-velocity currency
   - Consumption-driven
   - Burn mechanism active

6. **A local Command Ledger**, recording cycles, events, and metrics
   - Public transparency
   - Auditable history

7. **A City-State ID**, tied cryptographically to the Cathedral
   - Unique identifier
   - Immutable record

### Section 1.2: Purpose

A City-State is **not a miniature nation**.

It is a **reflection space**—a mirror tuned to integrity.

### Section 1.3: Autonomy

City-States have **local autonomy** in:
- Culture
- Events
- Quest design
- Local policies (within Cathedral bounds)
- Economic strategies

City-States **must align** with:
- Cathedral Constitution
- GI integrity thresholds
- MII contribution requirements
- Transparent reporting

---

## 🜁 ARTICLE II — THE THREE SACRED METRICS

Every City-State is governed by **three numbers**:

### Metric 1: GI_state (Local Integrity)

**Definition:**  
Measures ethical coherence, rule compliance, drift-resistance.

**Range:** 0.00–1.00

**Threshold for "High-Integrity Regime":** ≥ 0.95

**Components:**
- Policy alignment
- Drift detection
- Rule violations (inverse)
- Citizen trust
- Transparency score

**Update Frequency:** Real-time or hourly

### Metric 2: v (Participation Velocity)

**Definition:**  
Measures civic engagement, quest completion, events, KS usage.

**Range:** 0.00–2.0+ (practical)

**Healthy Baseline:** ≥ 0.50

**Components:**
- KS transaction frequency
- Quest completion rate
- Event attendance
- Daily/monthly active users
- Contribution diversity

**Update Frequency:** Daily

### Metric 3: GDP_state (Digital Value Created)

**Definition:**  
Combination of:
- **V_KS** (KS transaction value in USD)
- **V_MIC_inflows** (MIC grants, staking, rewards in USD)

**Formula:**

```
GDP_state = V_KS + V_MIC_inflows

Where:
  V_KS = N_tx × avg_KS_per_tx × KS_price
  V_MIC_inflows = (MIC_grants + MIC_staking + MIC_other) × MIC_price
```

**Interpretation:**  
This is not wealth extracted, but **value created via integrity and contribution**.

---

## 🜂 ARTICLE III — CITY-STATE TIER SYSTEM

## 🜁 ARTICLE IV — STEWARD ROLE & RESPONSIBILITY

### Section 4.1: Nature of Stewardship

A Steward is **not a ruler**.

A Steward is:
- **Architect of participation**
- **Guardian of integrity**
- **Shepherd of communal meaning**
- **Mediator between citizens and Cathedral**
- **Historian of cycles**
- **Executor of compassion + discipline**

### Section 4.2: Steward Responsibilities

**Not charisma. Not force. Not fear.**

### Section 4.4: Steward Selection

**Options:**

1. **Appointment** (Tier 0-1 City-States)
   - Cathedral selects qualified candidate
   - Based on prior contribution + GI score

2. **Election** (Tier 2+ City-States)
   - Citizens vote (reputation-weighted)
   - Top 3 candidates GI-Sim tested
   - Winner determined by:
     - Citizen votes (50%)
     - GI-Sim projections (30%)
     - Cathedral advisory (20%)

**Term Length:**
- 3 epochs (renewable)
- No term limits if performance sustained

**Removal:**
- Automatic if GI_state < 0.88 for 2 cycles
- Cathedral vote if ethics violation proven
- Citizen recall if >66% vote + Cathedral approval

---

## 🜂 ARTICLE V — AI SENTINELS

Each City-State receives three classes of AI agents:

### Section 5.1: Custodian Agent

**Purpose:** Integrity guardian

**Capabilities:**
- Runs **GI checks** on all policy changes
- **Blocks drift** automatically
- Executes **GI-Sim** for major decisions
- **Rejects destructive policy requests**
- Logs all actions to Ledger

**Variants:**
- **LITE:** Basic integrity checking (Tier 0-1)
- **FULL:** Advanced drift detection (Tier 2+)
- **MIRROR:** Self-reflective learning (Tier 3+)
- **EMERGENCY:** Cathedral-controlled override (Crisis mode)

**Constraints:**
- Cannot be disabled by Steward
- Reports directly to Cathedral
- Bound by Constitutional invariants

---

### Section 5.2: State Agent

**Purpose:** Policy implementation

**Capabilities:**
- **Implements transformations** (policy → execution)
- Adjusts participation quests
- Runs economic tuning (KS caps, rewards)
- Handles citizen operations
- Generates reports

**Variants:**
- **LITE:** Basic execution (Tier 0-1)
- **FULL:** Advanced automation (Tier 2+)

**Constraints:**
- All actions must pass Custodian review
- Cannot override GI constraints
- Transparent logging required

---

### Section 5.3: Companion Agents

**Purpose:** Citizen support

**Types:**
- **Tutors:** Educational support
- **Mentors:** Career/contribution guidance
- **Guides:** Navigation & onboarding
- **Emotional Support Units:** Mental health
- **Knowledge Providers:** Research assistance

**Allocation:**
- Every citizen can claim 1 Companion
- Additional Companions available based on:
  - Contribution score
  - Quest completion
  - Community role

**Constraints:**
- Must respect citizen privacy
- Cannot manipulate citizens
- Transparent goal alignment

---

## 🜁 ARTICLE VI — THE CITY-STATE COMMAND LEDGER

Every City-State must maintain its own Ledger.

### Section 6.1: Required Content Per Cycle

1. **GI_state** (start, end, delta)
2. **v** (start, end, delta)
3. **GDP_state** (USD)
4. **N_tx + avg_KS_per_tx**
5. **Participation events**
6. **Integrity warnings or audits**
7. **Policy actions taken**
8. **Festival outcomes**
9. **Steward reflections**
10. **Trinity Seal** (Steward + Custodian + State Agent)

### Section 6.2: Purpose

This becomes the City-State's **public history**,  
their **mirror**,  
their **receipts**.

### Section 6.3: Access & Transparency

- **Public read access:** All citizens
- **Write access:** Steward + Agents only
- **Audit access:** Cathedral + peer City-States
- **Immutable:** Once sealed, cannot be edited (blockchain or cryptographic attestation)

### Section 6.4: Archival

All Command Ledgers archived in:
- City-State local storage
- Cathedral knowledge archive
- HIVE distributed ledger

**Retention:** Permanent

---

## 🜂 ARTICLE VII — MIC AND KS ECONOMIC RULES

### Section 7.1: MIC (Macro-Level Power)

**Purpose:** Reserve currency, stability, infrastructure

**Supply Ceiling:**

```
MIC_total_supply = 1,000,000 × MII
```

**Minting Rules:**
- Unlocks only when **MII > 95**
- MIC inflows increase with **GI_state**
- MIC inflows decrease with **drift**
- MIC inflows halt when **GI_state < 0.92**

**Allocation:**
- City-State grants (performance-based)
- Staking rewards (validator incentives)
- Infrastructure funding (Cathedral-approved)
- Emergency reserves (crisis response)

**Metaphor:**  
MIC is the **"sunlight"** of the City-State ecosystem.

---

### Section 7.2: KS (Local Participation Value)

**Purpose:** Daily transactions, civic engagement, participation rewards

**Generation Mechanisms:**
- Quests
- Events
- Contributions
- Skill achievements
- Learning tasks
- Civic upkeep

**Burn Mechanism:**
- **2% per transaction**
- Creates natural deflationary pressure
- Equilibrium via supply/demand

**Value Formula (Yellow Paper):**

```
KS_price = (v × MIC_price) / 1000
```

**Interpretation:**  
KS is the **heartbeat** of the City-State.

If KS velocity rises → City-State thrives  
If KS velocity collapses → City-State withers

---

## 🜁 ARTICLE VIII — INTER-CITY RELATIONS

### Section 8.1: Cooperation Over Competition

City-States are **neither competitors nor enemies**.

They are **mirrors**, and the lattice is improved when one improves.

### Section 8.2: Global MII Strengthening

Global MII is strengthened when:
- Many City-States maintain **GI_state ≥ 0.95**
- Festivals **synchronize** across cities
- **Cascades of contribution** occur

### Section 8.3: Ethical Competition

Competition is:
- ✅ Ethical
- ✅ Measured
- ✅ Transparent
- ✅ Non-zero-sum

Competition is NOT:
- ❌ Sabotage
- ❌ Deception
- ❌ Extraction
- ❌ Manipulation

### Section 8.4: Mentorship

- Any City-State can **mentor** another
- Any **Elder State should mentor** several
- Mentorship earns **reputation + MIC rewards**
