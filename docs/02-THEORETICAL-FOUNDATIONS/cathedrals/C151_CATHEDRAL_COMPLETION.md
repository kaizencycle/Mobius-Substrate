Created comprehensive mapping of all `/docs` folder content to appropriate cathedrals:
- Primary documentation for each cathedral
- Shared documentation (all audiences)
- Documentation by category
- Navigation guides for each audience

**Mapped Categories**:
- Research Papers → FOR-ACADEMICS
- Economic Models → FOR-ECONOMISTS
- Governance Documents → FOR-PHILOSOPHERS + FOR-GOVERNMENTS
- Policy Briefs → FOR-GOVERNMENTS
- Technical Specifications → FOR-ACADEMICS + FOR-ECONOMISTS
- Implementation Guides → FOR-ECONOMISTS + FOR-GOVERNMENTS

---

### 4. Cathedral READMEs Updated ✅

Updated all four cathedral READMEs with:
- Links to endpoint documentation
- Links to machine-readable API (endpoints.json)
- Comprehensive "Related Documentation" sections
- Cross-references to `/docs` folder content

**Files Updated**:
- `FOR-ACADEMICS/README.md`
- `FOR-ECONOMISTS/README.md`
- `FOR-PHILOSOPHERS/README.md`
- `FOR-GOVERNMENTS/README.md`

---

### 5. Cathedral README Enhanced ✅

**File**: `docs/cathedrals/README.md`

Enhanced the main Cathedral README with:
- Link to complete Cathedral Index
- Link to Documentation Map
- Updated contributing guidelines

---

- 1 Cathedral README (`docs/cathedrals/README.md`)

### Endpoints Documented
- **FOR-ACADEMICS**: 5 endpoints
- **FOR-ECONOMISTS**: 7 endpoints
- **FOR-PHILOSOPHERS**: 5 endpoints
- **FOR-GOVERNMENTS**: 5 endpoints
- **Total**: 22 endpoints fully documented

### Documentation Mapped

---

## 🎯 Key Achievements

1. **Easy Point of Access**: Created `docs/cathedrals/INDEX.md` as the main entry point
2. **All Endpoints Documented**: Every endpoint in `endpoints.json` files now has comprehensive documentation
3. **Complete Documentation Scan**: All `/docs` folder content mapped to appropriate cathedrals
4. **Cross-References Established**: All cathedral READMEs now link to relevant documentation
5. **Navigation Improved**: Clear paths for each audience (researchers, economists, philosophers, policy makers)
