## Overview

Cathedrals are specialized documentation and governance domains within Mobius Systems. Each cathedral serves a distinct audience with tailored content, compliance requirements, and economic multipliers.

The `cathedrals/` directory also contains the **Core Doctrine** — the foundational documents that define the metaphysics, governance, and memory architecture of the HIVE civilization.

## Cathedral Directory

| Cathedral | Audience | Multiplier | Description | Entry Point |
|-----------|----------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| [FOR-ACADEMICS](/FOR-ACADEMICS/) | Researchers & Academia | 1.2× | Research papers, citations, peer review | [Research Cathedral →](/FOR-ACADEMICS/) |
| [FOR-ECONOMISTS](/FOR-ECONOMISTS/) | Economic Analysts | 1.5× | Tokenomics, MIC economy, incentive design | [Market Cathedral →](/FOR-ECONOMISTS/) |
| [FOR-GOVERNMENTS](/FOR-GOVERNMENTS/) | Policy Makers | 2.0× | Regulatory compliance, legislative drafts | [Policy Cathedral →](/FOR-GOVERNMENTS/) |
| [FOR-PHILOSOPHERS](/FOR-PHILOSOPHERS/) | Ethicists & Thinkers | 1.0× | Philosophy, ethics, manifestos | [Ethics Cathedral →](/FOR-PHILOSOPHERS/) |

### Machine-Readable Endpoints

Each cathedral provides a machine-readable `endpoints.json` for programmatic access:

- [FOR-ACADEMICS/endpoints.json](/FOR-ACADEMICS/endpoints.json)
- [FOR-ECONOMISTS/endpoints.json](/FOR-ECONOMISTS/endpoints.json)
- [FOR-PHILOSOPHERS/endpoints.json](/FOR-PHILOSOPHERS/endpoints.json)
- [FOR-GOVERNMENTS/endpoints.json](/FOR-GOVERNMENTS/endpoints.json)

## C-151 Economics

As of C-151, cathedral assignments affect **MIC minting rewards** through the Coordination-Weighted MIC Economy:

```
Final Reward = Base Reward × Cathedral Multiplier
```

Higher multipliers compensate for increased compliance overhead in domains like government and economic analysis.

### Key Documents

- [MIC Coordination Economics](./FOR-ECONOMISTS/MIC_COORDINATION.md) — Full C-151 economic specification
- [CoordinationMIC Contract](../../packages/gic-registry-contracts/contracts/C151/CoordinationMIC.sol) — Smart contract

| Sentinel | Cathedral | Role |
|----------|-----------|------|
| ATLAS | FOR-GOVERNMENTS | Architecture & Quality |
| AUREA | FOR-ECONOMISTS | Correctness & Logic |
| ECHO | FOR-ACADEMICS | Drift Detection |
| EVE | FOR-PHILOSOPHERS | Verifier/Reflector |

## 📚 Documentation Mapping

👉 **[Complete Documentation Map →](./DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md)** — Maps all `/docs` folder content to appropriate cathedrals

This map shows how every document in the `/docs` folder relates to the four cathedrals, making it easy to find relevant documentation for each audience.

## 🌟 What's New in C-153

### The Complete Civic Core:

**C-153** delivered the final three systems that complete the Mobius-HIVE civic architecture:

- ✅ **Regeneration System** — The Lotus Cycle ensures collapse becomes rebirth
- ✅ **Progression System** — The Ascension Ladder defines growth from Seed to Sovereign
- ✅ **Memory System** — The Hall of Ancestors preserves wisdom and grants immortality

Combined with previous work:
- ✅ Governance (Cathedral Rulebook + Citizens Edition)
- ✅ Operations (HIVE Operator Handbook)
- ✅ Economics (Yellow Paper + GDP tools)
- ✅ Onboarding (Citizen flow + video + quests)

**The HIVE is now fully architected** and ready for real-world implementation.

See **[C-153 Complete Summary](../cycles/C-153-Doctrine-Laws-and-Principles-COMPLETE.md)** for details.
