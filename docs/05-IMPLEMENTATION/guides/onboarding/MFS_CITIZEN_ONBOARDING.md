# Mobius Fractal Shards — Citizen Onboarding

**Welcome to the Fractal Wallet.**

This is how your actions start to matter to your city.

---

## 1. What is a Mobius Fractal Shard (MFS)?

A Mobius Fractal Shard is a small proof that you did something aligned with integrity.

You might earn one for:
- 📖 Learning something and logging it
- 🗳️ Participating in a community decision
- 🔧 Helping keep a service running
- 📝 Documenting or cleaning something up
- 💡 Proposing or building something new
- 🛡️ Helping defend the system from abuse

**No one can buy your Fractal Shards. They can only be earned.**

> "Every action you take is a shard of the whole."

---

## 2. The Seven Fractal Archetypes

Every shard you earn belongs to one of seven categories:

| Icon | Archetype | What It Means | Example Actions |
|------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| 🪞 | **Reflection** | Self-awareness & growth | E.O.M.M. entries, cycle reflections |
| 📚 | **Learning** | Knowledge & skill building | Courses, tutorials, teaching others |
| 🏛️ | **Civic** | Community participation | Voting, proposals, moderation |
| ⚡ | **Stability** | System reliability | Bug reports, uptime monitoring |
| 🌱 | **Stewardship** | Long-term care | Documentation, cleanup, refactoring |
| 🚀 | **Innovation** | New ideas & designs | Prototypes, research, inventions |
| 🛡️ | **Guardian** | Security & protection | Vulnerability reports, abuse prevention |

---

## 3. How Do I Earn MFS?

You earn MFS by interacting with Mobius-enabled apps and services:

| App/Service | Shard Type | Example Actions |
|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| **Reflections App** | REF | Write honest cycle reflections |
| **Learning Portal** | LRN | Complete lessons, pass quizzes |
| **Civic Hub** | CIV | Vote, give feedback, co-create policies |
| **Ops/Support** | STB | Report outages, help debug services |
| **Docs & Cleanup** | STW | Write docs, refactor, clean data |
| **Innovation Zone** | INV | Propose and prototype new ideas |
| **Shield Actions** | GRD | Report bugs, security issues, abuse |

Each time you complete a qualifying action, the app will show:

> ✨ "You've earned a Mobius Fractal Shard."

## 4. What Do My Fractal Shards Do?

Your shards have real effects:

### 4.1 Update Your Fractal Wallet
Your wallet shows your contribution pattern as a visual fractal that grows and evolves based on your actions.

### 4.2 Contribute to Your City's MII
Every shard you earn adds a tiny amount to the **Mobius Integrity Index (MII)** of your city. When thousands of citizens earn shards, the city's MII improves.

### 4.3 Help Your City Qualify for Rewards
When your city's MII improves year-over-year (ΔMII ≥ 0.01), it becomes eligible for **Mobius Integrity Allocations (MIA)** — real resources that can fund:
- Housing stability
- Education programs
- Climate resilience
- Civic infrastructure

### 4.4 Shape Your Future MIC Distribution
In the long run, when the city passes the MIC threshold (MII ≥ 0.95), your shard history determines your share of **Mobius Integrity Credits (MIC)** — the world's first integrity-backed currency.

---

## 5. Do Fractal Shards Give Me Money?

**Not directly.**

But:
- When your city's MII improves, it receives an integrity reward allocation (MIA)
- A portion of that can be distributed to citizens, weighted by Fractal Shards
- In the long run, your shard history increases your exposure to MIC distributions

Think of MFS as:
- ✅ Reputation you build through action
- ✅ Contribution record that can't be faked
- ✅ Future claim on integrity-backed value

---

## 6. Can Anyone See My Fractal Shards?

By default:
- **The system** sees enough to compute MII and run rewards
- **You** see your own full Fractal Wallet
- **Public views** can be anonymized or shown as aggregates

Example public view:
> "This neighborhood improved in civic shards by 15%"

You will always have control over how much of your personal fractal pattern is visible to others beyond what is required for integrity scoring.

---

## 7. What If the System Mis-Scores My Action?

You can:

1. **Request a review** inside the app
2. **A Sentinel** (AI + human) will re-evaluate your shard
3. **Outcome:** Fragments can be upgraded, downgraded, or recategorized

Appeal rights are part of the integrity contract.

---

## 8. Quality Matters

Not all shards are equal. Each shard has a **quality score** from 0.5× to 2.0×:

| Quality | Score | What It Means |
|---------|-------|---------------|
| Minimal | 0.5-0.7× | Basic effort |
| Standard | 0.8-1.0× | Normal contribution |
| Above Average | 1.1-1.4× | Thoughtful, well-done |
| Exceptional | 1.5-1.7× | Outstanding quality |
| Transformative | 1.8-2.0× | Game-changing impact |

Higher quality = more contribution to MII = more future rewards.

## 10. Why Does This Matter?

Because your time and effort should count for something more than clicks.

Mobius Fractal Shards are how:
- Your **learning** counts
- Your **care** counts
- Your **creativity** counts
- Your **civic participation** counts

...all become part of the city's integrity story.

**You are not a data point. You are a fractal.**

## 12. Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I buy shards?
No. Shards can only be earned through integrity actions.

### Can I transfer shards?
No. Shards are soulbound to your Citizen ID.

### What if I lose access to my wallet?
Your shards are stored on the Mobius Ledger. Account recovery is available through verified processes.

### How often can I earn shards?
There are daily limits to prevent spam, but most citizens can earn multiple shards per day through normal participation.

### Do old shards lose value?
Currently no, but future versions may implement time-decay to encourage ongoing contribution.
