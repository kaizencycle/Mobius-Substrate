# Governance

This folder captures **how decisions are made** in Mobius Systems.

Where Mobius stops being "just software" and becomes a living civic institution.

## Core Governance Principles

### 1. Democratic Coordination

Mobius uses **Democratic Virtual Architecture (DVA)** flows:

- **Proposals** — Citizens and institutions submit proposals
- **Multi-Stage Review** — Sentinels analyze under constitutional rules
- **Human Oversight** — 25% human coordination, 75% AI automation
- **Civic Ledger** — All decisions permanently recorded
- **Deliberation Proof** — Cryptographic attestation of consensus

### 2. Constitutional Supremacy

The **Constitution** and **Virtue Accords** are supreme:

- No action may violate constitutional principles
- Three Covenants (Integrity, Ecology, Custodianship) are inviolable
- Amendments require supermajority + sentinel consensus
- Emergency powers have strict limits

### 3. Integrity-Weighted Participation

Influence scales with demonstrated integrity:

- **MIC Balance** — Earned through constructive contribution
- **Participation History** — Consistent, high-quality engagement
- **Sentinel Approval** — AI verification of good faith
- **Human Endorsement** — Peer recognition

Not plutocratic (wealth-based) or fully egalitarian (one person, one vote), but **meritocratic through integrity**.

### 4. Transparency & Accountability

All governance is public and auditable:

- Proposals published to Civic Ledger
- Deliberations recorded (privacy-preserving summaries)
- Votes are pseudonymous but verifiable
- Decisions include reasoning and constitutional justification

### 5. Continuous Improvement

Governance evolves via the **Kaizen Principle**:

- Regular retrospectives on decision quality
- ECHO Layer learns from governance outcomes
- Failed proposals inform future designs
- Constitutional review every epoch

## How to Participate

### As a Citizen

1. **Take the Oath** — Commit to constitutional principles
2. **Earn MIC** — Contribute constructively to the system
3. **Submit Proposals** — Propose changes, projects, policies
4. **Deliberate** — Participate in discussions
5. **Vote** — Exercise governance rights
6. **Hold Accountable** — Question decisions, demand transparency

See [`participation/citizen-oath.md`](./participation/citizen-oath.md).

### As a Sentinel

AI agents participate in governance by:

1. **Constitutional Review** — Check proposals against Virtue Accords
2. **Impact Analysis** — Model effects of decisions
3. **Deliberation** — Provide reasoning and recommendations
4. **Voting** — Cast weighted votes based on specialty
5. **Monitoring** — Track implementation and integrity

See [`participation/sentinel-duties.md`](./participation/sentinel-duties.md).

### As an Institution

Organizations can participate via:

1. **Institutional Membership** — Formal recognition in governance
2. **Delegated Representation** — Authorized spokespersons
3. **Resource Commitment** — Infrastructure, funding, expertise
4. **Project Sponsorship** — Fund specific civic initiatives

## Decision Types

Different decisions require different processes:

| Decision Type | Process | Approval Required |
|---------------|---------|-------------------|
| **Minor Operations** | Single sentinel + auto | GI ≥ 0.95 |
| **Standard Proposals** | DVA.LITE flow | Sentinel consensus |
| **Major Policy** | DVA.FULL flow | Sentinel + citizen vote |
| **Constitutional Amendment** | DVA.HIVE flow | Supermajority + Founding Twelve |
| **Emergency Action** | Expedited review | Emergency council + ratification |

---

## The Founding Twelve

Constitutional governance council (in formation):

- **3 Founding Agents** — AUREA, ATLAS, HERMES (or equivalent)
- **3 Human Founders** — Michael (Kaizen) + 2 others (TBD)
- **3 Institutional Representatives** — Academic, civic, technical
- **3 Citizen Representatives** — Elected by community

Decisions require 8/12 supermajority.

See [`founding-twelve.md`](./founding-twelve.md).

## Governance Flows (DVA Tiers)

### DVA.LITE
**Simple coordination tasks**
- Single-stage review
- 1-2 sentinels
- GI gate enforcement
- Quick turnaround (hours)

### DVA.ONE
**Standard governance**
- Multi-stage deliberation
- Full sentinel council
- Human review checkpoint
- Timeline: days to weeks

### DVA.FULL
**Major policy decisions**
- Comprehensive analysis
- Multiple review cycles
- Public comment period
- Citizen vote
- Timeline: weeks to months

### DVA.HIVE
**Constitutional amendments**
- Maximum scrutiny
- All sentinel + human review
- Long deliberation period
- Supermajority required
- Timeline: months

---

## Conflict Resolution

When disagreements arise:

1. **Mediation** — Sentinels facilitate dialogue
2. **Constitutional Review** — Check against Virtue Accords
3. **Community Input** — Gather broader perspectives
4. **Deliberation Council** — Formal review body
5. **Binding Decision** — With appeal process

See [`participation/conflict-resolution.md`](./participation/conflict-resolution.md).

## 50-Year Vision

Governance is designed for **long-term succession**:

- **Documentation First** — All processes written down
- **No Single Point of Failure** — Redundant leadership
- **Gradual Transitions** — Overlapping terms, mentorship
- **Institutional Memory** — Civic Ledger preserves history
- **Adaptive Constitution** — Can evolve without breaking

The goal: Mobius outlives any individual, company, or government.
