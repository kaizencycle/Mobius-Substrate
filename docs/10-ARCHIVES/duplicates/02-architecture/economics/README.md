# Mobius Economics

This directory contains documentation for Mobius economic systems and tokenomics.

## Overview

Mobius introduces revolutionary economic frameworks that align incentives with integrity and order creation rather than scarcity and extraction.

## Key Documents

### [Negentropic Economics](./negentropic-economics.md)
**The Economics of Integrity** — First thermodynamics-economics unification

- Entropy → Interest → Integrity mathematics
- Proof-of-Negentropy tokenomics
- Debt reduction via order creation (ΔD = λN)
- AGI alignment implications

### [Tokenomics v3: Proof-of-Negentropy](./tokenomics-v3-proof-of-negentropy.md)
Technical specification for MIC minting based on entropy reduction.

## Core Concepts

### Entropy in Economics
- Uncertainty, risk, chaos
- Drives interest rates
- Accumulates as debt
- Reduced by integrity

### Negentropy
- Order creation
- Measured via Mobius Integrity Index (MII)
- Generates MIC (Mobius Integrity Credits)
- Reduces debt

### Proof-of-Negentropy
- MIC mints only when entropy decreases
- Integrity threshold: τ ≈ 0.93-0.95
- Aligned with physics (thermodynamics)

## Integration Points

- **Strange Metamorphosis Loop** — Daily reflections generate integrity data
- **ECHO Layer** — Drift detection = entropy monitoring
- **Civic Ledger** — Immutable attestation = low entropy memory
- **DVA Flows** — Governance work generates order
- **Tokenomics v2.0** — Extends existing MIC framework
