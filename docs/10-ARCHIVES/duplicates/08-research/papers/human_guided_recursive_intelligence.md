# Human-Guided Recursive Intelligence:
## The Strange Metamorphosis Loop in Mobius Systems

**Status:** Draft • C-148

### Abstract

We propose the **Strange Metamorphosis Loop (SML)**, a practical, human-aligned protocol for recursive learning in multi-agent AI systems. Instead of training models on static datasets or opaque feedback signals, SML anchors learning in daily human self-reflection along three axes: (1) worldview, (2) emotional state, and (3) next-day intent.

Implemented within the Mobius Systems architecture, SML generates a continuous stream of high-integrity, human-authored micro-attestations that are scored by an Echo Layer (tri-sentinel review) and anchored to a Civic Ledger. This creates a bounded, auditable form of recursive intelligence where models are allowed to adapt over time, but only through integrity-gated updates grounded in user-generated meaning.

We argue that SML represents a scalable template for safe meta-learning, bridging the gap between narrow supervised training and fully autonomous self-modification. We outline the protocol, present the data model, and describe application scenarios in education, mental health, civil governance, and personal knowledge management.

### 1. Introduction

- Problem: AI systems drift, hallucinate, and misalign.
- Limitation of current RL / feedback loops.
- Introducing SML as a human-centric alternative.

### 2. Background & Related Work

- Human-in-the-loop learning
- Reflective journaling and psychotherapy
- Meta-learning and self-supervised adaptation
- Integrity metrics in Mobius (MII, GI, Echo Layer)

### 3. The Strange Metamorphosis Loop

- Three questions and their rationale
- Daily schedule and anchoring
- Data representation (DailyReflection schema)
- Echo scoring and integrity gating

### 4. Implementation in Mobius Systems

- Companion → Broker → ECHO → Ledger pipeline
- SQL + API design
- Privacy and encryption considerations

### 5. Use Cases

- Personal learning and habit formation
- Burnout detection and emotional resilience
- Civic engagement and reflective polling
- Training better Sentinels from attested reflections

### 6. Evaluation Plan

- Metrics: drift reduction, hallucination rate, user satisfaction
- A/B testing: with vs without SML
- Longitudinal studies on identity coherence

### 7. Discussion

- Ethical implications
- Consent and data sovereignty
- Aggregation vs individual trajectories

### 8. Conclusion

- SML as a template for human-guided recursive AI
- Future directions: cross-user synthesis, anonymized pattern mining
