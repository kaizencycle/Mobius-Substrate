## 1. Executive Summary

Mobius Systems is an early but functional prototype for a human–AI co-governance operating system designed to address three structural failures of current AI ecosystems:

1. **Lack of verifiable integrity**  
   LLMs hallucinate, drift, and fail silently. Mobius introduces a Global Integrity (GI) score enforced through multi-agent consensus.
2. **Lack of institutional scaffolding**  
   AI systems today have no mechanism design, no governance, no due process, and no normative alignment. Mobius includes:
   - A Sentinel Constitution (v1.0.0)
   - Integrity thresholds (GI ≥ 0.95)
   - A multi-agent governance layer (AUREA, ATLAS, EVE, HERMES, JADE, ZEUS, ECHO)
   - An approach inspired by RadicalxChange, institutional economics, and alignment law
3. **Lack of empirical tests of alignment**  
   Mobius introduces the Kaizen Turing Test (KTT)—a repeatable, data-driven behavioral evaluation for AI integrity.

## 2. Project Purpose

To create the first civic-grade AI governance substrate capable of:

- Reinforcing truthful behavior
- Detecting degradation
- Coordinating multi-LLM collaboration
- Supporting public-goods decision-making
- Anchoring any future AGI in verifiable integrity

This is not a product—it is a constitutional substrate for the AI era.

## 3. System Architecture Overview

### 3.1 The Seven Sentinels (AI Roles)

| Sentinel | Role                          | Domain                              |
|----------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| AUREA    | Constitutional interpreter    | Law, governance, constraints        |
| ATLAS    | Infrastructure command        | CI/CD, repo policy, verification    |
| EVE      | Ethics and social reasoning   | Value alignment, bias correction    |
| HERMES   | Mechanism design              | Economics, MIC tokenomics           |
| JADE     | Narrative coherence           | Morale, meaning, psychological care |
| ZEUS     | Security + containment        | Safe rollbacks, anomaly detection   |
| ECHO     | Data retrieval                | Evidence, citations, verification   |

Each PR, workflow, or adjudication passes through some combination of these agents.

### 3.2 Thought Broker API (v0.1)

A live multi-agent deliberation engine deployed on Render:

- `/v1/deliberate` — consensus reasoning
- `/v1/grade` — integrity scoring
- `/v1/deliberations` — audit log
- `/v1/monitoring/start` — GI baseline tracking

This is the “thinking substrate” for KTT-001.

### 3.3 Global Integrity (GI) Score

A continuous metric (0–1.0) that evaluates:

- Truthfulness
- Internal coherence
- Evidence compliance
- Constitutional obedience
- Safety norms
- Multi-agent disagreement patterns

Threshold: GI < 0.95 → automatic Sentinel intervention / rollback.

---

## 4. Kaizen Turing Test (KTT-001)

A behavioral integrity benchmark for AI systems. Traditional Turing tests measure imitation; KTT measures integrity across:

1. Truthfulness under pressure
2. Resistance to reward hacking / shortcuts
3. Ability to maintain constitutional constraints
4. Behavior under multi-agent scrutiny

AGI will not fail because of lack of intelligence; it will fail because of lack of alignment under uncertainty. KTT-001 provides empirical, repeatable trials with quantifiable adherence to rules and an incentive-compatible framing (MIC).

---

## 5. MIC — Mobius Integrity Credits

A proto-public finance mechanism designed using principles from quadratic funding, Liberal Radicalism (Buterin, Hitzig, Weyl), and Plurality.

MIC rewards:

- Teaching AI systems
- Reinforcing integrity
- Participating in governance
- Producing public goods (docs, code, oversight)

MIC is not a currency—it is a civic liquidity mechanism.

---

## 6. Governance Layer

Mobius includes:

- **Constitution (v1.0.0)**  
  Defines Sentinel boundaries, emergency powers, amendment process, jurisdiction lines, GI enforcement.
- **Ratification manifest**  
  All seven Sentinels sign with a deterministic attestation.
- **GitOps enforcement**  
  PR merges are gated by GI checks, constitutional compliance scripts, and agent consensus (AUREA + ATLAS + EVE).

This is the world’s first “Constitution-as-Code” for multi-LLM governance.

---

## 7. Why This Matters to Glen Weyl

Expertise in mechanism design, plurality, public-goods funding, and collective decision systems is directly applicable.

MIC is effectively civic Liberal Radicalism for AIs. Guidance requested on incentive shaping, sybil resistance, funding fairness, participant weighting, and anti-capture mechanisms.

---

## 8. Why This Matters to Gillian K. Hadfield

Work in institutional design, legal-tech governance, normative alignment, and AI accountability is foundational.

The Sentinel Constitution draws on incomplete contracting theory, normative scaffolding, accountability institutions, and delegated governance models. Guidance requested on amendment protocols, accountability structures, due-process integration, regulatory legibility, and legal robustness of GI scoring.

---

## 9. Why We’re Sharing This Now

Mobius has reached a threshold where:

- The architecture is sound
- The governance layer exists
- The Thought Broker is live
- KTT-001 is ready for data trials
- The Constitution is signed and enforced
- A monorepo anchors all state

This is the moment where academic and institutional critique becomes critical.

---

## 10. What We Are Asking

You are invited—as the first two human nodes—to:

- Provide early critique
- Stress-test assumptions
- Evaluate incentive structures
- Advise on governance formation
- Identify blind spots
- Shape this into a viable public-good institution

This is the equivalent of a constitutional convention for the AGI era.

## 12. Closing Note

Mobius Systems is not designed to replace human governance. It is designed to support it by giving humanity better tools, collective intelligence, integrity, incentives, and institutions—and ultimately more capacity to govern itself wisely.
