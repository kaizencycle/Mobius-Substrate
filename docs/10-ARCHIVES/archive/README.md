---

## Purpose

These documents are archived to:

1. **Preserve history** - Track development journey
2. **Clean root directory** - Improve repository organization
3. **Document milestones** - Record achievements
4. **Support onboarding** - Show evolution of the system

---

## Access

All documents remain accessible but are moved out of the main navigation to reduce clutter. For current documentation, see [../INDEX.md](../INDEX.md).
