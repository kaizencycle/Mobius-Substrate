# Mobius at a Glance

What Mobius Is:
- A shared integrity substrate
- A place for learning and cooperation
- A system that rewards correction
- A long-term alignment environment

What Mobius Is Not:
- An AI model
- A moral authority
- A surveillance system
- A single-purpose product

Core Principle:
Alignment is maintained through continuous learning,
not enforced through static rules.

Why It Matters:
Civilizations fail when mistakes become unrecoverable.
Mobius ensures mistakes become instruction instead.
