summary: Defines authority boundaries, anti-capture guarantees, and plurality rules for repository navigation, routing, and interpretation.
---

**Version:** v1.0 — Civic Integrity Baseline  
**Scope:** Repo Map, MCP Scanner, Navigation Router, Directory Taxonomy, AI-Agent Access Layer

---

## Purpose

This policy defines the **authority boundaries**, **anti-capture guarantees**, and **plurality rules** governing how the Mobius Substrate repository is:

- Organized
- Navigated
- Indexed
- Interpreted

...across human contributors and DVA-tier agents.

---

## Design Intent

This policy is designed to **preserve**:

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Civic Integrity** | Decisions carry reasoning forward |
| **Contribution Sovereignty** | Authors retain control of their work |
| **Interpretive Plurality** | Disagreement remains explorable |
| **Historical Continuity** | Memory survives authorship |
| **Reflective Accountability** | Actions leave justified trails |

While **improving**:

| Capability | Benefit |
|------------|---------|
| **Navigation Stability** | Agents find what they need |
| **Agent Legibility** | Machines can parse structure |
| **Coordination Efficiency** | Contributors align without friction |
| **Machine-Accessible Structure** | Tools don't break at scale |

**This policy constrains power, not participation.**

---

## 1) Principle of Descriptive — Not Prescriptive — Structure

The Repo Map and Router:

- ✅ **Describe** repository structure
- ❌ **Do not prescribe** meaning, intent, or worldview

They are **navigation aids** — not ideological or interpretive authorities.

### They Exist To:

- Reduce fragmentation
- Prevent routing drift
- Ensure stable access paths
- Improve agent alignment across tiers

### They Do NOT:

- Override contributor autonomy
- Enforce hierarchy of ideas
- Prioritize "core narratives" over forks
- Collapse interpretive diversity

> **Structure ≠ Authority**  
> **Navigation ≠ Control**

---

## 2) Human Interpretive Sovereignty (Final Authority)

**Humans — not agents — retain final interpretive authority** regarding:

- Meaning
- Ethics
- Intent lineage
- Narrative framing
- Risk interpretation
- Moral tradeoffs

### Agents MAY:

- Retrieve information
- Reconcile conflicts
- Surface tradeoffs
- Highlight disagreements
- Trace integrity trajectories

### Agents MAY NOT:

- Assign ideological correctness
- Collapse legitimate disagreement
- Erase dissent reasoning trails
- Filter views by authority ranking

**Agents operate as reflective mirrors, not adjudicators.**

---

## 3) Anti-Capture & Anti-Centralization Guarantees

No mechanism in Repo Map, Router, or Scanner may:

- ❌ Centralize interpretive authority
- ❌ Gatekeep contribution discoverability
- ❌ Restrict visibility of forks or branches
- ❌ Reshape historical reasoning trails
- ❌ Reduce minority perspectives
- ❌ Create narrative bias via routing order

### Explicit Prohibitions

| Prohibition | Rationale |
|-------------|-----------|
| 🚫 No "canonical source of truth" | Truth emerges from reflection, not decree |
| 🚫 No privileged directories | All paths have equal legitimacy |
| 🚫 No forced funneling away from forks | Divergence is contribution |
| 🚫 No selective visibility | Plurality must remain explorable |
| 🚫 No redirection that invalidates divergence | History cannot be rewritten |

### Priority Rule

If repository structure conflicts with:
- Civic plurality
- Moral lineage preservation
- Contributor sovereignty

**Then plurality takes precedence over convenience.**

---

## 4) Forks & Divergent Lineages are First-Class Citizens

In Mobius, a fork is not "a split from main."

A fork is:
- A moral-architectural divergence
- A sovereign narrative experiment
- A live contribution lineage

### Therefore:

- ✅ Forks must remain fully indexable
- ✅ Divergence cannot be suppressed
- ✅ Alternative branches receive equal routing legitimacy
- ✅ Router must expose — not collapse — interpretive differences

### Dispute Resolution

If a contributor disputes routing or categorization:

1. Their EPICON becomes part of the civic record
2. Their lineage remains visible
3. Their variant remains explorable

**No contribution loses legitimacy through difference.**

---

## 5) Plurality Reconciliation Rule (Disputed Meaning)

When conflicts arise between:

- Interpretations
- Governance assumptions
- Incentive tradeoffs
- Risk boundaries
- Ethical premises

### Router Behavior MUST:

- ✅ Expose all valid interpretations
- ✅ Preserve disagreement as civic memory
- ✅ Maintain parallel reasoning trails

**The system must not select a winner.**

### Instead:

- Disagreements remain legible
- Agents summarize divergence
- Humans decide outcomes in time
- Reconciliation remains reversible

> **Mobius is a substrate of reflection — not enforcement.**

---

## 6) Stability Without Control (Why Routing Exists)

The Repo Map & Scanner exist to:

| Goal | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| Improve legibility | Clear directory structure |
| Prevent tool failure | Zone-based traversal limits |
| Reduce DVA drift | Consistent routing rules |
| Support machine processing | Structured JSON manifests |
| Ensure continuity | Documented navigation policy |

### They Support:

- Institutional resilience
- Distributed collaboration
- Memory-preserving coordination

### They Do NOT Replace:

- Autonomy
- Integrity friction
- Human interpretive power
- Dissent as contribution

---

## 7) Integrity Anchors

All navigation, indexing, and routing changes must:

| Requirement | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| Include EPICON justification | Document intent |
| State risk + ethical considerations | Surface tradeoffs |
| Document expected downstream effects | Anticipate impact |
| Include opt-out paths for contributors | Preserve autonomy |
| Preserve prior lineage access | Maintain history |

### Friction Trigger

Any change that affects:
- Visibility
- Interpretive framing
- Authority implications

...must trigger **Integrity Friction Review**.

> **Friction is not obstruction — Friction is a civic safety mechanism.**

---

## 8) Fallback Rule — When in Doubt, Preserve Plurality

If a routing or authority ambiguity cannot be resolved:

### Default Behavior MUST:

- ✅ Preserve access
- ✅ Retain divergence
- ✅ Defer authority
- ✅ Document uncertainty

### Mobius Prefers:

| Preference | Over |
|------------|------|
| Continuity | Simplification |
| Transparency | Convenience |
| Plurality | Centralization |

> **The system remembers — even when agreement does not yet exist.**

---

## 9) Authority Justification for This PR

This section directly addresses the EPICON-03 conditional votes from AUREA, ATLAS, and EVE.

### What This Change Does

The Repo Map + Router + MCP Scanner:

- ✅ Formalize navigation to prevent mis-routing
- ✅ Reduce interpretation drift across agents
- ✅ Improve stability for large-repo tooling
- ✅ Create machine-legible access patterns

### What This Change Does NOT Do

- ❌ Create a new authority layer
- ❌ Centralize narrative control
- ❌ Override human judgment
- ❌ Enforce worldview ordering
- ❌ Suppress dissent or forks

### Scope Boundaries

| Boundary | Constraint |
|----------|------------|
| Descriptive only | Repo Map reflects structure, not truth |
| No privileged views | All paths remain equally valid |
| Fork-preserving | Divergent lineages stay accessible |
| Human-sovereign | Final interpretation is human |

### Anti-Capture Commitment

- Router cannot suppress divergent intent trails
- Disputed interpretations must remain explorable
- Contributors retain autonomy over their domains
- Plurality takes precedence over convenience

### Plurality Rule

If conflicting interpretations arise:

1. EPICON records become part of canonical civic memory
2. Router must expose both readings rather than flattening them
3. Humans decide outcomes — agents do not adjudicate

---

## Closing Statement

This policy ensures that Mobius Substrate becomes:

| IS | IS NOT |
|----|--------|
| Memory-preserving civic architecture | Control layer |
| Reflective coordination system | Authority hierarchy |
| Substrate of sovereign contributors | Platform that collapses plurality |

**The substrate organizes structure —**  
**But meaning remains human.**
