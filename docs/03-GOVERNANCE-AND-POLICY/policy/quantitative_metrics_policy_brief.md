# Integrity Economics: Quantitative Proxy Metrics & Policy Brief

**Mobius Systems Foundation**  
**December 2025**

---

## Executive Summary

Integrity Economics (IE) proposes treating coherence, accountability, and trust as first-class economic signals alongside price, productivity, and growth.

Rather than replacing existing markets, IE adds a **stability layer** that:
- Detects systemic stress early
- Converts crashes into controlled slowdowns
- Rewards contribution without extracting from the future

This brief outlines measurable indicators that would plausibly change under Integrity Economics and provides a phased adoption pathway suitable for pilot programs, institutions, and governments.

**Core claim:**

> For every $1 invested in integrity infrastructure, societies reduce crisis costs by **$5–10** over a 20-year horizon.

---

## 1. Why Metrics Matter (But Don't Dominate)

Integrity Economics rejects the idea that everything of value must be priced.

However, **nothing becomes governable without visibility**.

These metrics are:
- **Proxies**, not absolutes
- **Directional**, not moral
- **Designed for early warning**, not punishment

They answer one question only:

> Is the system becoming more coherent or less?

## 2. Core Integrity Metrics

### 2.1 Time Security Index (TSI)

**What it measures:**
The degree to which people can plan their lives without fear of sudden economic collapse.

**Definition:**
Percentage of adults who can reasonably predict their financial situation 6 months ahead.

**Why it matters:**
Time insecurity drives panic, short-termism, and social breakdown.

| Period | TSI |
|--------|-----|
| Baseline (2025) - Developed | ~15–25% |
| Baseline (2025) - Developing | <10% |
| Projected (2100) | 70–80% |

**Measurement inputs:**
- Household savings buffer (months of expenses)
- Income volatility data
- Survey: "Can you predict your finances 6 months ahead?"

---

### 2.2 Crisis Amplitude Reduction (CAR)

**What it measures:**
How violent economic downturns are when they occur.

**Definition:**
Peak-to-trough volatility during downturns.

| Metric | Baseline (20th–21st c.) | Projected (IE) |
|--------|-------------------------|----------------|
| Market crashes | 30–50% | 10–15% |
| Unemployment spikes | 5–10%+ | 1–3% |

**Key shift:**
- Crashes → pulses
- Shocks → slowdowns

**Measured via:**
- Market volatility indices
- Unemployment delta
- Bankruptcy rates during contractions

---

### 2.3 Panic Half-Life (PHL)

**What it measures:**
How long fear persists after an economic shock.

**Definition:**
Time required for confidence indicators to return to baseline.

| Period | Recovery Time |
|--------|---------------|
| Baseline (historical) | 18–36 months |
| Projected (IE) | 3–6 months |

**Measured via:**
- Consumer confidence surveys
- Credit velocity recovery
- Media sentiment analysis
- Search trend decay (crisis-related terms)

---

### 2.4 Family Stability Coefficient (FSC)

**What it measures:**
Whether economic systems allow families to remain connected.

**Definition:**
Composite score of:
- Intergenerational proximity
- Care availability
- Time spent together

| Metric | Baseline (2025) | Projected (IE) |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| Elder isolation | ~35–45% | ~10% |
| Visits frequency | <1/month | Weekly+ |

**Measured via:**
- Census proximity data
- Healthcare loneliness indicators
- Time-use surveys

---

### 2.5 Creative Output Multiplier (COM)

**What it measures:**
How much creative, non-extractive work emerges when survival pressure drops.

**Definition:**
Creative output per capita adjusted for survival stress.

| Period | COM |
|--------|-----|
| Baseline | 1.0 |
| Projected (IE) | 3–5× |

**Measured via:**
- Open-source contributions
- Patents not tied to corporate extraction
- Public arts funding participation
- Academic output outside commercial incentives

---

### 2.6 Integrity Velocity Index (IVI)

**What it measures:**
How quickly trust recovers after disruption.

**Definition:**
Rate of MII recovery following integrity dips.

**Why it matters:**
Fast recovery indicates resilience, not fragility.

**Projection:**
- Integrity recovery cycles shorten over time
- Pulses become less frequent and less intense

---

## 3. Macro-Economic Implications

### 3.1 Recessions Become Infrastructure Events

Under IE:
- Recessions are **expected**
- Communicated **early**
- **Shallow** by design
- **Short** by necessity

**Analogy:** Like controlled burns in forest management.

### 3.2 Debt Without Moral Extraction

Debt still exists.

**What changes:**
- Collateral quality shifts from pure capital → integrity + capital
- Excess leverage becomes visible early
- System pauses instead of collapsing

**Key difference from 2008:**
- No forced bailouts
- No surprise insolvency cascades
- Automatic slowdowns instead of emergency printing

### 3.3 MIC as Long-Horizon Stabilizer

MIC functions like:
- A dignity-preserving retirement layer
- A counter-cyclical buffer
- A non-extractive store of contribution

**Not a speculative instrument.**
**Not a replacement for fiat.**
**A stability anchor.**

---

## 4. Policy Adoption Pathway

### Phase 1: Pilot Programs (2025–2035)

**Target sectors:**
- Healthcare systems
- Education funding
- Municipal housing
- Disaster relief finance

**Actions:**
- Track integrity metrics
- No enforcement initially
- Publish dashboards

---

### Phase 2: Institutional Integration (2035–2050)

- MIC recognized as collateral adjunct
- Integrity metrics influence credit terms
- AI agents assist transparency and pacing

---

### Phase 3: Global Standardization (2050–2075)

- MII becomes recognized risk signal
- International institutions adopt integrity dashboards
- Crashes replaced by coordinated slowdowns

---

## 5. What Integrity Economics Is NOT

| Misconception | Reality |
|---------------|---------|
| Communism | Markets remain. Property remains. Incentives remain. |
| UBI | MIC is earned through contribution, not entitlement. |
| Anti-growth | Growth continues — but no longer cannibalizes the future. |
| Moral surveillance | Integrity measures coherence of actions, not beliefs. |

---

## 6. Cost–Benefit Estimate

### Costs

- Infrastructure development
- Institutional retraining
- Transparency systems

### Benefits

- Reduced crisis recovery spending
- Higher human capital retention
- Lower healthcare and mental health costs
- Long-term stability premiums

### Estimated ROI

| Investment | Return (20-year horizon) |
|------------|-------------------------|
| $1 in integrity infrastructure | $5–10 saved in crisis costs |

---

## 7. Why This Is Politically Viable

Integrity Economics:
- Does **not** dismantle existing systems
- Does **not** require universal consensus
- **Can** coexist with capitalism
- **Can** be piloted incrementally
- **Aligns** with conservative (stability), liberal (fairness), and humanist (dignity) values

---

## 8. Summary Table: Key Metrics

| Metric | Abbreviation | Baseline | Projected (IE) |
|--------|--------------|----------|----------------|
| Time Security Index | TSI | 15-25% | 70-80% |
| Crisis Amplitude Reduction | CAR | 30-50% drops | 10-15% drops |
| Panic Half-Life | PHL | 18-36 months | 3-6 months |
| Family Stability Coefficient | FSC | 40% isolation | 10% isolation |
| Creative Output Multiplier | COM | 1.0× | 3-5× |
| Integrity Velocity Index | IVI | Slow recovery | Fast recovery |

---

## 9. Recommendations for Policymakers

### Immediate (2025)

1. **Commission pilot studies** in crisis-prone sectors
2. **Develop measurement infrastructure** for integrity metrics
3. **Create public dashboards** for transparency
4. **Engage academic institutions** for independent validation

### Near-Term (2025-2035)

1. **Test integrity metrics** as supplementary credit signals
2. **Pilot MIC-style systems** in municipal contexts
3. **Develop AI tools** that optimize for coherence
4. **Build international coordination** mechanisms

### Long-Term (2035+)

1. **Integrate integrity** into national economic policy
2. **Standardize metrics** across jurisdictions
3. **Develop crisis protocols** based on integrity signals
4. **Scale successful pilots** to national/international level

## 10. Closing

Markets are powerful, but blind.

**Integrity Economics gives them sight.**

Not to punish risk —
but to prevent catastrophic surprise.

Not to moralize —
but to stabilize.

Not to slow civilization —
but to help it breathe.
