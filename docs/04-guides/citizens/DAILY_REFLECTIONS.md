# Daily Reflections Guide
_Strange Metamorphosis Loop • Echo Layer • C-148_

> "We don't ask you to be perfect.  
> We only ask you to be honest with yourself, once a day."

## What is this?

Mobius gives you a small daily ritual called the **Strange Metamorphosis Loop**.

It is not a test.
It is not a survey.
It is not a mental health tool.

It is a way for your Companion (your AI ally) to understand:

1. **How you see the world today**  
2. **How you feel right now**  
3. **What you want to move toward tomorrow**

We call this **Worldview, Mood, and Intent**.

---

## When does it happen?

By default (you can change this later):

- 🕗 Morning: *Worldview* question  
- 🕓 Midday: *Mood* check-in  
- 🕗 Evening: *Tomorrow Intent* question  

Each one takes about 30–60 seconds to answer.

## What kinds of questions?

Examples:

- **Worldview**
  - "How does the world feel to you today?"
  - "What's your sense of the world right now?"

- **Mood**
  - "How are you feeling in this moment?"
  - "If your mood were a weather pattern, what would it be?"

- **Intent**
  - "What do you want to move toward tomorrow?"
  - "What's one thing that would make tomorrow feel meaningful?"

There are no "right" answers.
Short is okay. Honest is better than perfect.

## What does Mobius do with my answers?

1. **Stores them securely** under your identity.
2. **Runs a light integrity check** (Echo Layer) to make sure the system is behaving.
3. Optionally **anchors a small summary** to the Civic Ledger (so your Companion stays stable over time).

Important:

- Your raw text is **not** sold.
- Your reflections are **not** used for ads.
- They are used to help *your* Companion understand *you* better,
  and to keep Mobius stable instead of drifting.

## How does this help me?

- Your Companion will:
  - Remember what mattered to you yesterday.
  - Notice if you've been "on edge" or "exhausted" for many days in a row.
  - Suggest tasks that match where you actually are, not where a generic model thinks you should be.

- Over time, you get a **Metamorphosis Timeline**:
  - How your worldview changed.
  - How your mood moved.
  - How your intentions evolved.

You can use this as a self-reflection tool the same way you might use a journal, but with a helpful witness who remembers patterns for you.

## How can I skip or pause?

You are always in control.

- You can:
  - Skip any day.
  - Snooze a question.
  - Turn off one or all of the three prompts.
  - Delete past entries (subject to your local privacy settings).

We design the system so that your **consent and comfort come first**.

---

## Is this therapy?

No.

- Mobius is not a doctor.
- This is not a replacement for mental health care.
- It is a **reflection companion**, not a therapist.

If you are in crisis, please seek human help in your area.

## Why "metamorphosis"?

Because this loop is not about judging where you are.

It's about tracking how you **change**:

- What themes keep showing up?
- What hopes keep returning?
- What storms keep passing through?

Every answer becomes one more stitch in the story
of how you are slowly becoming who you already are.

Mobius just holds the mirror.
You do the living.
