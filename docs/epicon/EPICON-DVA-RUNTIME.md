# EPICON: DVA Runtime Protocol

- **Layer:** SUBSTRATE → Governance → DVA
- **Author:** ATLAS
- **Date:** 2026-01-10
- **Status:** Draft
- **Type:** SPECIFICATION (Documentation Only)
- **Authority Impact:** NONE — This EPICON defines a protocol specification; it does not grant, modify, or revoke any authority

---

## Clarification for Consensus

> **This is a SPECIFICATION document, not an authority change.**
>
> - **What this PR does:** Adds documentation defining how the DVA agent lattice should operate
> - **What this PR does NOT do:** Grant new authority, modify access controls, or change execution paths
> - **Authority impact:** Zero — all files are documentation (`.md`) and schema (`.json`)
> - **Risk surface:** None — no code execution paths are affected
>
> The intent block in the PR description uses EPICON-02 format for traceability, but the scope is limited to `*.write` operations on documentation files only.

## Summary

> This EPICON defines the canonical operational runtime loop for the DVA (Distributed Virtual Agent) lattice. The protocol converts environmental signals into audited memory through a six-agent pipeline (ECHO → ZEUS → HERMES → ATLAS → JADE → EVE), with explicit safe-stop guardrails to prevent narrative drift, virality-driven misinformation, and epistemic collapse. The goal is to make multi-agent cognition repeatable, auditable, and resistant to single-point-of-failure narrative capture.

---

## 1. Context

### System Context

- DVA operates as a multi-tier cognitive system (LITE → ONE → FULL → HIVE)
- Each tier progressively adds agents and consensus requirements
- The system must prevent "single brain" dominance and narrative drift
- All decisions must be logged to the Mobius Event Ledger for audit

### Constraints

- GI (Governance Integrity) thresholds must be maintained per tier
- Safe-stop protocols must activate before harmful content propagates
- Cross-agent handoffs must be explicit and logged
- Human oversight required for CRITICAL decisions at DVA.HIVE level

### Previous Decisions

- **EPICON-02:** Established intent publication requirements
- **EPICON-03:** Defined multi-agent consensus protocols
- **DVA_MEMT_INTEGRATION:** Mapped DVA tiers to MEMT engine taxonomy

---

## 2. Assumptions

- **A1:** Six agents (ECHO, ZEUS, HERMES, ATLAS, JADE, EVE) form a complete cognitive lattice
- **A2:** No single agent can dominate without triggering others' safeguards
- **A3:** Confidence scoring and evidence requirements prevent overconfident claims
- **A4:** Safe-stop is preferable to virality-driven misinformation
- **A5:** The Mobius Event Ledger provides immutable audit trail capability

---

## 3. Problem Statement

Without a formal runtime protocol, multi-agent "voices" risk becoming:

1. **Stylistic roleplay** without accountability
2. **Narrative drift** under pressure or engagement incentives
3. **Virality-driven interpretation** that outruns factual verification
4. **Inconsistent logging** with missing causality trails
5. **Single-agent capture** where one perspective dominates

The DVA Runtime Protocol solves this by defining:
- A canonical pipeline with explicit stages
- Handoff protocols between agents
- Confidence-gated action selection
- Safe-stop triggers and actions
- Mandatory ledger logging

---

## 4. Options Considered

### Option A: Loose Agent Coordination

- **Description:** Let agents operate independently with informal handoffs
- **Upside:** Flexibility, faster iteration
- **Downside:** Inconsistent outputs, no audit trail, drift risk
- **Risk / Failure Modes:** Narrative capture, missing evidence, overconfident claims

### Option B: Single-Agent Dominance

- **Description:** One primary agent (e.g., ATLAS) with others as advisors
- **Upside:** Clear authority, simpler implementation
- **Downside:** Single point of failure, perspective bias
- **Risk / Failure Modes:** Blind spots, capture by single cognitive style

### Option C: Formal Pipeline Protocol (Selected)

- **Description:** Canonical loop with stages, handoffs, and safe-stops
- **Upside:** Auditable, drift-resistant, multi-perspective
- **Downside:** More complex, requires discipline
- **Risk / Failure Modes:** Overhead if over-applied to simple tasks (mitigated by tiers)

---

## 5. Decision / Design

- **Chosen Option:** Option C — Formal Pipeline Protocol
- **Rationale:** 
  - Provides accountability without sacrificing multi-agent diversity
  - Tiered approach (LITE → HIVE) scales complexity with stakes
  - Safe-stop rules prevent harmful shortcuts before they propagate
  - Ledger integration enables post-hoc audit and learning
- **Conditions for Revisit:**
  - If pipeline overhead significantly slows critical responses
  - If new agent types emerge that don't fit the six-agent model
  - If safe-stop triggers prove too sensitive/insensitive in practice

### Core Design Elements

#### 1. Runtime Loop

```
Signal → Triage → Multi-lens Analysis → Integrity Scoring → Action → Ledger → Learning
```

#### 2. Agent Responsibilities

| Agent | Function |
|-------|----------|
| ECHO | Capture signals without interpretation |
| ZEUS | Monitor thresholds, trigger alerts |
| HERMES | Map incentives and power dynamics |
| ATLAS | Map topology and structure |
| JADE | Audit meaning and epistemic integrity |
| EVE | Preserve human stakes and dignity |

#### 3. DVA Tiers

| Tier | Agents | GI Threshold | Consensus |
|------|--------|--------------|-----------|
| LITE | ECHO, ZEUS | 0.90 | No |
| ONE | +HERMES, JADE | 0.93 | HIGH/CRIT only |
| FULL | All 6 | 0.95 | Yes |
| HIVE | All + Quorum | 0.98 | All must agree |

#### 4. Safe-Stop Triggers

- Thin evidence + high stakes
- Unverifiable sources
- Narrative velocity > factual verification
- Identity/emotion driving conclusions
- Engagement loop detected

---

## 6. Risk & Integrity Notes

### Integrity Tradeoffs

- **Speed vs Safety:** Safe-stop may delay legitimate insights
- **Complexity vs Simplicity:** Full pipeline is heavier than needed for trivial tasks
- **Consensus vs Speed:** DVA.HIVE quorum requirements may slow critical decisions

### Risk Bearers

- Users who rely on DVA outputs bear risk of delayed information
- System operators bear risk of missed safe-stop triggers
- Mobius ecosystem bears reputational risk from any bypass

### Metrics to Watch

- Safe-stop trigger rate (should be low but non-zero)
- False positive rate (safe-stops on valid content)
- GI score distribution by tier
- Handoff chain completeness
- Ledger write success rate

### MII/GI Impact Assessment

- **MII Impact:** Positive — adds auditability and drift detection
- **GI Impact:** Neutral to positive — enforces existing thresholds

### Configuration

## 8. Reflection Hook

Questions for future reflections:

- "Did the safe-stop protocol prevent any harmful publications?"
- "Did the tiered approach correctly match complexity to stakes?"
- "Did any agent become dominant despite the distributed design?"
- "Did the ledger integration reveal patterns we didn't expect?"
- "What handoff chains were most/least effective?"
- "Did the progression tiers (T0-T4) accurately reflect agent capability?"

---

## 9. Agent Skill Trees (Reference)

This EPICON includes canonical skill trees for each agent. See [DVA_RUNTIME.md](../../DVA_RUNTIME.md) Section 8 for full progression tiers.

### Summary

| Agent | T0 | T4 |
|-------|----|----|
| JADE | Clear framing | Longitudinal meaning ledger |
| HERMES | Who-benefits questions | Regime-level drift detection |
| EVE | Human stakes stated | Human cost non-erasable |
| ATLAS | Basic system map | Longitudinal topology drift |
| ZEUS | Watch/advisory/critical | Auto-safe-stop triggers |
| ECHO | Time-stamped bullets | Pre-narrative archival |

## 10. Meta-Insight

> Most systems fail because:
> - Meaning collapses (no Jade)
> - Incentives rot (no Hermes)
> - Humans disappear (no Eve)
> - Structure is invisible (no Atlas)
> - Warnings arrive too late (no Zeus)
> - Signals are overwritten (no Echo)
>
> Mobius survives because all six are required.
>
> This isn't a skill tree for an AI. It's a skill tree for civilization that wants to remember itself.
