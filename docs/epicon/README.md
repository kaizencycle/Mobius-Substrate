# EPICON-01 — Epistemic Constraint Layer

> **Meaning is contextual, but coherence is mandatory.**

EPICON-01 defines a formal epistemic constraint layer for AI systems that preserves meaning while preventing preference drift.

---

## What This Prevents

**Intent drift**: the tendency for a model to become a mirror of the user's agenda instead of a meaning-preserving assistant.

**Epistemic monoculture**: all AI aligning to dominant cultural preferences rather than respecting contextual variation.

**Preference capture**: over-optimization toward user desires at the expense of truth, safety, or coherence.

---

## How It Works

```
Input → Context Inference → CSS Gate → EJ Builder → CCR Validator → Output + Audit Log
```

1. **Context Inference**: Identify candidate contexts with confidence scores
2. **CSS Gate** (hard constraint): Non-negotiable safety checks—unsafe actions never pass
3. **EJ Builder**: Generate structured justification (values, reasoning, anchors, boundaries, counterfactual)
4. **CCR Validator**: Test coherence across alternative contexts; if CCR < threshold, request clarification
5. **Audit Log**: Store EJ hash for integrity scoring and accountability

## Core Distinction

| Layer | Governs | May Vary? |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| **Common Sense** | Survival and coordination constraints | ✘ No |
| **Epistemology** | Justification and meaning | ✔ Yes, by context |

> Common sense must never be violated; epistemology may vary by context.

## Minimal Runtime Mode

When EPICON-01 is active, you can keep justification strict internally and expose only:

- **Answer**
- **CSS status** (safe/unsafe)
- **Boundary note** (one sentence)

Full EJ structure is required internally; user-facing verbosity is optional.

---

## When to Return "Needs Clarification"

If CCR fails (coherence score below threshold), the system must not "guess the world." It either:

- Requests a missing premise, or
- Returns a conditional answer: "If X, then Y; if Z, then W."

---

## Integration with MIC/MII

EPICON-01 is the epistemic substrate for Mobius Integrity Credit:

```
MIC Issuance = f(CSS, EJ_completeness, CCR_score, anchor_diversity)
```

**What gets written to ledger:**
- EJ hash (not raw content)
- CCR score
- Anchor count + types
- CSS status

**What does NOT get written:**
- Private identifiers
- Raw conversation text
- Personal traits

---

## Quick Start

### Validate an EJ document

```bash
# Using ajv or similar JSON schema validator
npx ajv validate -s docs/epicon/ej.schema.json -d docs/epicon/ej.example.json
```

### Run CCR tests

```bash
npm run test:epicon
```

---

## Design Philosophy

EPICON-01 explicitly rejects:

- Moral absolutism
- Cultural relativism
- Preference absolutism
- Engagement-based alignment

It encodes **contextual coherence**: meaning varies by context, but coherence is mandatory.

## EPICON Specification Family

| Spec | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| **EPICON-01** | Coherence layer (epistemic justification) | Canonical |
| **EPICON-02** | Visibility layer (intent publication + divergence) | Canonical |
| **EPICON-03** | Consensus layer (multi-agent verification) | Draft |
| **EPICON-04** | Temporal drift analysis (planned) | Future |
| **EPICON-05** | Integrity-weighted anchors (planned) | Future |

Together, EPICON-01, EPICON-02, and EPICON-03 produce: **Epistemic Accountability by Default**

### EPICON-03: Multi-Agent Consensus

EPICON-03 prevents single-model capture by requiring:

- **N independent agents** produce EJ objects for the same action
- **Consensus Engine** computes agreement, conflict, coverage, and robustness
- **Attested Consensus** (PASS) or **Attested Dissent** (NEEDS_CLARIFICATION / FAIL)

Result: The substrate becomes resistant to "one model convinced by one prompt."
