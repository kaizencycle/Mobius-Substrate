# 🏛️ Mobius Cathedral Architecture — C-149

**Public-Facing Academic Excellence**

**Purpose:** Transform technical monorepo into four sacred paths for academics, economists, philosophers, and governments.

---

## 🎯 Design Principle

**"One Repository, Four Sacred Paths"**

Each audience gets their own entrance to the cathedral:

- **Academics** → Research & papers
- **Economists** → Models & policy
- **Philosophers** → Ethics & frameworks
- **Governments** → Legislation & implementation

2. Click "I'm an Academic" → Enter FOR-ACADEMICS/
3. Click PAPERS/SML/ → Read paper

### Economist Journey
1. Land on repository → See cathedral entrance
2. Click "I'm an Economist" → Enter FOR-ECONOMISTS/
3. Click GLOBAL-APPLICATIONS/US-FEDERAL-RESERVE/ → See $1.16T savings

### Philosopher Journey
1. Land on repository → See cathedral entrance
2. Click "I'm a Philosopher" → Enter FOR-PHILOSOPHERS/
3. Click EXISTENTIAL-RISK/sml-safety-proofs/ → Read AGI safety

## ✅ Implementation Checklist

### Structure (Complete)
- [x] Create directory structure
- [x] Add .gitkeep to empty directories
- [x] Create cathedral-create.sh script

### README Files (Complete)
- [x] 00-START-HERE/README.md
- [x] FOR-ACADEMICS/README.md
- [x] FOR-ECONOMISTS/README.md
- [x] FOR-PHILOSOPHERS/README.md
- [x] FOR-GOVERNMENTS/README.md
- [x] PUBLIC/README.md
- [x] README-CATHEDRAL.md (new root)

### Content Migration (Future)
- [ ] Copy papers to FOR-ACADEMICS/PAPERS/
- [ ] Copy economic models to FOR-ECONOMISTS/
- [ ] Copy ethics docs to FOR-PHILOSOPHERS/
- [ ] Create policy briefs for FOR-GOVERNMENTS/
- [ ] Add brand assets to PUBLIC/

## 🔄 Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Structure Creation ✅
Non-destructive creation of cathedral directories.

### Phase 2: README Population ✅
Welcoming README for each cathedral entrance.

### Phase 3: Content Migration (Future)
Copy (not move) existing content into cathedrals:
- Papers → FOR-ACADEMICS/PAPERS/
- Economic models → FOR-ECONOMISTS/ECONOMIC-MODELS/
- Ethics docs → FOR-PHILOSOPHERS/ETHICAL-FOUNDATIONS/
- Manifestos → FOR-PHILOSOPHERS/MANIFESTOS/

### Phase 4: Content Generation (Future)
Create new content specific to each audience:
- Policy briefs (2-page PDFs)
- Legislative text
- ROI calculators
- Thesis templates

---

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Improved Discoverability
- **Before:** "Where are the papers?" (unclear)
- **After:** FOR-ACADEMICS/PAPERS/ (3 clicks)

### Audience Clarity
- **Before:** Mixed technical/academic content
- **After:** Clear separation by audience

### Navigation Speed
- **Before:** 5-10 clicks to find content
- **After:** 3 clicks maximum

### Collaboration
- **Before:** Difficult for non-technical audiences
- **After:** Clear entry points for all

---

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

**None.** This is purely additive.

- ✅ Original structure preserved
- ✅ Content **copied**, not moved
- ✅ All existing paths still work
- ✅ Backward compatible

---

## 🔙 Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

```bash
# Cathedral is additive only
# Simply delete new directories
rm -rf 00-START-HERE FOR-ACADEMICS FOR-ECONOMISTS FOR-PHILOSOPHERS FOR-GOVERNMENTS PUBLIC

# Original structure untouched
```
