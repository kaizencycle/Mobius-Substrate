# Citizen Oversight System

**"See power while it's being exercised."**

## What is Citizen Oversight?

The Citizen Oversight System allows ordinary people to observe, understand, and respond to AI behavior while it is happening—not afterward, not in hindsight, but in real time.

This is not surveillance. This is transparency.

## Design Principles

### 1. Visibility (See)
Citizens can view integrity metrics, intent declarations, and behavioral patterns over time.

### 2. Comprehension (Understand)
Every signal is human-readable, plain-language summarized, and historically contextualized.

### 3. Participation (Act)
Citizens can flag concerns, submit evidence, and participate in governance.

### 4. Memory (Remember)
Oversight records cannot be deleted, altered, or PR-washed away.

## What This System Is NOT

- **Not surveillance** — We watch systems, not people
- **Not censorship** — We document, not control
- **Not a police system** — We observe, not punish
- **Not corporate/state owned** — Civic infrastructure belongs to everyone

---

## The Civic Contract

> This system does not promise safety.
> It promises visibility.
>
> Visibility gives people time.
> Time gives people choice.
