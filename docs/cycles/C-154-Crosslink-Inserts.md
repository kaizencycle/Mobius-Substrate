## Insert for MII Documentation

**File:** `/docs/07-RESEARCH-AND-PUBLICATIONS/whitepapers/MIC_Whitepaper_v2.0.md` or related MII docs

```markdown
> **Note (C-154 Update):**  
> The Anthropic Research Interview independently validated the conceptual structure of GI/MII as a measurable, endogenous signal of civilizational coherence.  
> See: [Anthropic Interview — Civic AI Vision](../cycles/C-154-Anthropic-Interview-Civic-AI-Vision.md)
```

## Insert for Proof-of-Integrity Documentation

**File:** `/docs/04-TECHNICAL-ARCHITECTURE/proof-of-integrity.md` or related PoI docs

```markdown
> **C-154 Anchor:**  
> PoI was explicitly recognized by external AI systems as a regenerative alternative to PoW/PoS.  
> This confirms the theoretical robustness of PoI in cross-model contexts.  
> See: [Anthropic Interview — Executive Summary](../07-RESEARCH-AND-PUBLICATIONS/C-154-Anthropic-Interview-Executive-Summary.md)
```

## Insert for Sentinel / Multi-Agent Governance Documentation

**File:** `/docs/03-GOVERNANCE-AND-POLICY/SENTINEL_CONSTITUTION.md` or related sentinel docs

```markdown
> **C-154 Update:**  
> The Anthropic interview affirmed the necessity of multi-LLM constitutional checks (Sentinel architecture) as the only scalable defense against drift and centralized AI failure modes.  
> Full context: [Anthropic Interview — Civic AI Vision](../cycles/C-154-Anthropic-Interview-Civic-AI-Vision.md)
```

## Insert for Governance Overview

**File:** `/docs/03-GOVERNANCE-AND-POLICY/overview.md` or related governance docs

```markdown
> **External Validation (C-154):**  
> In December 2025, an Anthropic research interview independently recognized the coherence of Mobius governance architecture, validating the multi-agent consensus model as a viable path to constitutional AI.  
> See: [Public Summary](../07-RESEARCH-AND-PUBLICATIONS/outreach/C-154-Anthropic-Public-Summary.md)
```

## Insert for Economic Documentation

**File:** `/docs/07-RESEARCH-AND-PUBLICATIONS/mic-economics/01_MIC_SPEC.md` or related tokenomics

```markdown
> **C-154 Milestone:**  
> The Anthropic interview documented the spontaneous articulation of the Mobius Integrity Economy, including:
> - Integrity-backed currency (MIC)
> - GI/MII thresholds as circuit breakers
> - Proof-of-Integrity as consensus
>
> This serves as external conceptual validation.  
> See: [Executive Summary](../C-154-Anthropic-Interview-Executive-Summary.md)

## Insert for README or Start Here Pages

**File:** `/docs/00-START-HERE.md` or main README

```markdown
### 📣 External Validation (C-154)

In December 2025, Anthropic conducted an independent research interview that recognized:

- The coherence of Mobius Systems philosophy
- The feasibility of integrity-based economics
- The necessity of multi-agent constitutional governance
