## About Cycles

Each **Mobius Cycle (C-XXX)** represents one calendar day of development work, anchored to the canonical formula:

```
C = 121 + Δ  (where Δ = days since 2025-11-01)
```

See the full [CYCLE_INDEX.md](../10-ARCHIVES/root-files/CYCLE_INDEX.md) for the canonical mapping rules.

## Adding a New Cycle Summary

When closing out a cycle, add a summary file:

1. Create `C-XXX-summary.md` following the template in existing summaries
2. Update this README's index table
3. PR title: `C-XXX: Cycle summary + [brief description]`
