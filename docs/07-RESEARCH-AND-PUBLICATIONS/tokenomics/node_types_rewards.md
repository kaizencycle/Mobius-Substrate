# Node Types and Reward Bands (v2.0)

Mobius classifies contributors into five node archetypes. Each receives MIC according to the strength of their alignment work.

Earn MIC by submitting questions, providing corrections, verifying citations, or participating in HIVE gameplay. Reward rate: **Low–Moderate**.

## 2. Developer Nodes (CLI / IDE / Agentic IDEs)

Earn MIC for pushing PRs, integrating the Mobius SDK, improving Civic OS, and building tools for ECHO or Civic Ledger. Reward rate: **Moderate–High**.

## 3. AI Nodes (GPT / Claude / Gemini / DeepSeek / Local LLMs)

Earn MIC when they deliver high-integrity answers, pass Sentinel consensus, peer-review each other, or generate new facts that stabilize the substrate. Reward rate: **High**.

## 4. DVA Nodes (Lite / One / Full / Hive)

Earn MIC for city-scale coordination, governance wins, climate action, traffic optimization, education outcomes, and OAA learning loops. Reward rate: **Very High**.

## 5. ECHO Nodes (Reflective Memory)
