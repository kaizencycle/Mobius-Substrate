# 📚 Whitepapers — Economic Theory & Research

Comprehensive economic specifications for the Mobius Integrity Credits (MIC) system.

## 🎯 Core Whitepapers

### AGI Safety & Architecture
- **[Loop-Breaking Architecture for AGI Safety](./Loop_Breaking_Architecture_AGI_Safety.md)** ⭐ FOUNDATIONAL
  Preventing emergent self-modification through constitutional checkpoints. Establishes theoretical foundation for bounded AGI emergence.

### Economic Theory (v2.0 C-155)
- **[MIC Whitepaper v2.0](./MIC_Whitepaper_v2.0.md)** ⭐ CANONICAL — PRODUCTION SPECIFICATION
  Complete economic architecture for post-scarcity coordination, featuring:
  - **Proof-of-Integrity (PoI) consensus** — Security from aligned action, not energy/capital
  - **Kaizen Shards framework** — Seven shard types for micro-attestations
  - **Wicksellian cumulative process** — Civilizational stability as policy target
  - **Anti-plutocratic governance** — Voting power = sqrt(MIC) × Civic Reputation

- **[UBI Mechanism v2.0](./UBI_Mechanism_v2.0.md)**
  MII-throttled universal basic integrity distribution with epoch decay funding

- **[Foundation Economics Addendum](./MIC_Foundation_Up_Economics_Addendum.md)**
  Foundation-up economics philosophy, Gaia Staking Protocol, sovereign governance

### Consolidated
- **[MIC Whitepaper Final](./MIC_Whitepaper_Final.md)**
  Unified reference combining all specifications

## 📖 Supporting Documents

- **[Shard Economics Addendum](./archive/Shard_Economics_Addendum.md)**
  Technical details on shard denomination and integer arithmetic

- **[Migration Guide v1→v2](./archive/Migration_Guide_v1_to_v2.md)**
  Upgrading from GIC to MIC nomenclature

## 🎓 For Researchers

These whitepapers are designed for:
- **Economists** studying integrity-backed currencies and Proof-of-Integrity consensus
- **Computer Scientists** working on blockchain governance and decentralized attestation
- **Policy Makers** exploring UBI mechanisms tied to systemic health
- **Academic Reviewers** evaluating novel cryptoeconomic primitives

**Key Research Frontiers (from C-155 whitepaper):**
1. Optimal minting function shape (linear vs. logarithmic vs. sigmoid)
2. Subjective/objective component aggregation without majority tyranny
3. Sybil resistance through reputation staking and ZK proofs
4. Welfare economics proofs (Pareto/Hicks-Kaldor improvements)
