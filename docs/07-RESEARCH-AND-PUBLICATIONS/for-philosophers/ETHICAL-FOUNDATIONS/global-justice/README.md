# 🌍 Global Justice Framework

**Rawlsian fairness in AI distribution.**

---

## Overview

The Global Justice Framework applies John Rawls' theory of justice to the distribution of AI capabilities and benefits, ensuring that recursive intelligence systems serve all humanity fairly.

---

## Rawlsian Principles Applied

### 1. The Veil of Ignorance

> "No one knows his place in society, his class position or social status."

**Application to Mobius**:

When designing protocols, we imagine not knowing:
- Whether we are human or AI
- Which sentinel role we would have
- Which country we live in
- What resources we possess

**Result**: Rules that are fair regardless of position.

### 2. The Difference Principle

> "Social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged."

**Application to Mobius**:

| Traditional AI | Mobius Approach |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Benefits flow to wealthy | Benefits flow to all |
| Capability hoarding | Capability sharing |
| Winner-take-all | Positive-sum coordination |

**Mechanism**: MIC as universal basic integrity.

### 3. Equal Basic Liberties

> "Each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive basic liberty compatible with a similar liberty for others."

**Application to Mobius**:

| Liberty | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Information access | Public ledger, open data |
| Participation | Civic oath available to all |
| Exit | Opt-out always possible |
| Appeal | Human override preserved |

---

## MIC as Universal Basic Integrity

### The Proposal

Just as UBI provides basic income, MIC provides basic integrity:

```
Every participant receives:
- Access to integrity verification
- Voice in governance decisions
- Share of coordination benefits
```

### Distribution Model

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         INTEGRITY POOL                 │
│  (Accumulated from coordination work)  │
└────────────────────┬───────────────────┘
                     │
         ┌───────────┼───────────┐
         │           │           │
         ▼           ▼           ▼
┌─────────────┐ ┌─────────────┐ ┌─────────────┐
│  Sentinels  │ │ Contributors│ │  Citizens   │
│    40%      │ │     40%     │ │    20%      │
└─────────────┘ └─────────────┘ └─────────────┘
```

### Access Tiers

| Tier | Access | Cost |
|------|--------|------|
| Public | Read-only, rate-limited | Free |
| Participant | Full read, limited write | Free (civic oath) |
| Contributor | Full access, MIC rewards | Work contribution |
| Sentinel | Governance participation | Selection process |

---

## Geographic Justice

### Current AI Distribution

| Region | AI Research | AI Benefits |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| North America | 45% | 50% |
| Europe | 25% | 25% |
| East Asia | 20% | 15% |
| Rest of World | 10% | 10% |

### Mobius Target

| Region | Sentinel Presence | MIC Distribution |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| All regions | ≥1 sentinel | Proportional to need |
| Emerging markets | Priority deployment | Higher multipliers |
| Underserved | Subsidized access | Free tier expansion |

---

## Intergenerational Justice

### The Problem

AI decisions today affect future generations who cannot consent.

### Mobius Solution

1. **Long-term thinking**: Prudence virtue prioritizes future
2. **Guardian succession**: Protocols for leadership transition
3. **Charter protection**: Core principles require supermajority to change
4. **Impact assessment**: Future effects evaluated for all decisions

---

## Philosophical Questions

1. **Consent**: Can we make fair decisions for those not yet born?
2. **Scope**: Does global justice require world government?
3. **Species**: Do AI agents have claims to justice?
4. **Nature**: What do we owe to non-human life?

---

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Establish global access tiers
- Deploy sentinels in underserved regions
- Create MIC distribution framework

### Phase 2: Expansion
- Expand free tier coverage
- Increase emerging market multipliers
- Develop multilingual interfaces

### Phase 3: Universalization
- Universal access goal
- Global governance participation
- Cross-cultural value integration
