# ⚖️ Tri-Sentinel Governance

**Separation of powers in AI systems.**

---

## Overview

Tri-Sentinel Governance applies the classical separation of powers to artificial intelligence systems, ensuring no single AI agent can accumulate unchecked authority.

---

## The Three Branches

### Executive Branch: ZEUS

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Role** | Enforcement and action |
| **Powers** | Execute decisions, manage operations |
| **Limits** | Cannot make policy, subject to review |
| **Virtue** | Courage (action despite uncertainty) |

### Legislative Branch: EVE

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Role** | Ethics and policy |
| **Powers** | Propose rules, define standards |
| **Limits** | Cannot enforce, subject to veto |
| **Virtue** | Justice (fair rule-making) |

### Judicial Branch: ATLAS

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Role** | Verification and appeal |
| **Powers** | Review decisions, interpret rules |
| **Limits** | Cannot initiate action, bound by precedent |
| **Virtue** | Prudence (wise judgment) |

## Historical Inspiration

### Montesquieu's Spirit of Laws

> "When the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person, or in the same body of magistrates, there can be no liberty."

Mobius applies this principle to AI:
- No sentinel holds multiple branch roles
- Power is distributed, not concentrated
- Checks prevent abuse

### Madison's Federalist Papers

> "Ambition must be made to counteract ambition."

Sentinel incentives are designed so that:
- Each branch benefits from checking others
- Power grabs reduce rewards
- Collaboration yields highest returns

---

## Conflict Resolution

When branches disagree:

### Level 1: Deliberation
- Branches discuss in council
- Consensus sought through dialogue

### Level 2: Voting
- If deliberation fails, vote called
- Majority determines outcome (3/5)

### Level 3: Human Override
- If conflict persists, humans decide
- Guardian council makes final call

### Level 4: Charter Amendment
- Persistent conflicts may require rule changes
- Unanimous consent for amendments

---

## Performance Metrics

| Branch | Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|--------|
| ZEUS | Execution accuracy | ≥ 99% |
| EVE | Policy clarity | ≥ 95% acceptance |
| ATLAS | Review thoroughness | 100% coverage |

---

## Philosophical Tensions

### Efficiency vs. Safety

More checks = slower decisions but safer outcomes.

**Current Balance**: 
- Routine: Fast (single sentinel)
- Significant: Medium (3/5 consensus)
- Critical: Slow (unanimous + human)

### Consistency vs. Adaptation

Precedent provides stability but may prevent improvement.

**Current Balance**:
- Core principles: Immutable
- Applications: Evolvable
- Edge cases: Human-guided

## Research Questions

1. **Optimal Division**: Are three branches optimal for AI systems?
2. **Emergent Power**: Can informal power undermine formal structure?
3. **Scaling**: How does tri-governance scale to many sentinels?
4. **Hybrid Systems**: How do human and AI branches interact?
