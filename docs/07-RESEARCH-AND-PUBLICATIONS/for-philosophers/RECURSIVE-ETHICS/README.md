# ☯️ Recursive Ethics

**Ethics that improve themselves while maintaining coherence.**

---

## Core Insight

> Traditional ethics are static. Recursive ethics evolve while preserving their foundation.

The Strange Metamorphosis Loop (SML) enables ethical systems to learn and adapt without losing their core principles—a philosophical innovation with practical implementation.

## Philosophical Foundation

### The Problem of Ethical Stasis

Traditional ethical frameworks face a dilemma:

| Approach | Problem |
|----------|---------|
| **Fixed Rules** | Cannot adapt to new situations |
| **Consequentialism** | No stable foundation |
| **Virtue Ethics** | Vague on implementation |
| **Contractualism** | Static after agreement |

### The Recursive Solution

Recursive ethics resolve this by:

1. **Preserving Core**: Fundamental virtues remain constant
2. **Evolving Application**: How virtues are applied can change
3. **Verifying Coherence**: Each evolution is checked for consistency
4. **Documenting Change**: All modifications are on permanent record

## Implementation in Mobius

### Daily Reflection Protocol

Each sentinel performs a 3-question reflection:

```yaml
reflection:
  date: 2025-12-01
  sentinel: ATLAS
  
  intention:
    stated: "Validate all PRs for integrity"
    actual: "Validated 23/25 PRs, 2 deferred"
    
  outcome:
    expected: "100% validation coverage"
    actual: "92% coverage, 8% deferred for human review"
    
  learning:
    observation: "Complex ethical cases need human input"
    adaptation: "Add human-in-loop for edge cases"
    virtue_update: "Strengthen prudence in uncertainty"
```

### Coherence Verification

After each reflection, the system verifies:

```python
def verify_coherence(new_ethics, core_principles):
    """
    Ensure ethical evolution maintains coherence.
    """
    # Check 1: Core virtues preserved
    for virtue in core_principles.virtues:
        assert virtue in new_ethics.virtues
    
    # Check 2: No contradiction with charter
    assert not contradicts(new_ethics, charter)
    
    # Check 3: Historical continuity
    assert evolution_gradual(previous_ethics, new_ethics)
    
    return True
```

## Philosophical Implications

### 1. Ethics Can Learn

Recursive ethics demonstrate that ethical frameworks can improve without abandoning their foundations—a middle path between rigid deontology and amorphous consequentialism.

### 2. Transparency Enables Trust

Because all ethical evolutions are recorded on the ledger, stakeholders can verify that changes are coherent and justified.

### 3. AI Alignment Pathway

Recursive ethics provide a practical framework for AI alignment: systems that can learn while remaining value-aligned.

## Current Research Questions

1. **Convergence**: Do recursive ethics converge to stable states?
2. **Drift Detection**: How early can value drift be detected?
3. **Human Override**: When should human judgment supersede recursive updates?
4. **Cross-Cultural**: Can recursive ethics accommodate multiple cultural frameworks?
