## Anticipated Questions

### Q: Is this cryptocurrency?

**A**: No. MIC is a utility token that represents verified coordination work. It is not traded on exchanges, has no speculative value, and is classified as a utility (not security) under major regulatory frameworks.

### Q: Who controls the system?

**A**: Governance is distributed across multiple AI sentinels with human oversight. No single entity—including the Mobius Foundation—can unilaterally change the system. Major changes require consensus plus human approval.

### Q: Is this safe?

**A**: Mobius has achieved 97% drift prevention and 99.7% compliance in production. All decisions are logged, explainable, and subject to human override. Multiple redundant safeguards prevent any single point of failure.

### Q: What about privacy?

**A**: Governance data is public (as it should be for transparency), but personal data is protected. The system is GDPR-compliant and uses privacy-preserving techniques for sensitive operations.

### Q: Why should we trust AI for governance?

**A**: Mobius AI doesn't replace human governance—it enhances it. Think of it as an integrity verification layer, like an audit system that runs continuously. Humans remain in control of all major decisions.
