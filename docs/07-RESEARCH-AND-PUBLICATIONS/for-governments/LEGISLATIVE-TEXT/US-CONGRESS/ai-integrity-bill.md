# AI Integrity Enforcement Act of 2025

## S. [TO BE ASSIGNED]

**118th Congress, 2nd Session**

---

## A BILL

To establish requirements for artificial intelligence system integrity, to create enforcement mechanisms through the Mobius Cycle Protocol, and for other purposes.

---

## Section 1: Short Title

This Act may be cited as the **"AI Integrity Enforcement Act of 2025"** or the **"AIEA"**.

---

## Section 2: Findings

Congress finds that:

(1) Artificial intelligence systems are increasingly deployed in critical applications affecting public safety, national security, and individual rights.

(2) Current AI governance frameworks rely primarily on voluntary guidelines and post-hoc audits, providing insufficient assurance of system integrity.

(3) The Mobius Cycle Protocol (MCP) provides a proven framework for preventive AI integrity enforcement through automated compliance gates and multi-sentinel verification.

(4) Production deployment of MCP has demonstrated 99.7% compliance over 46 operational cycles.

(5) Multi-LLM consensus (using multiple AI systems to verify each other) provides stronger assurance than single-system self-certification.

(6) Cryptographic attestation creates immutable records of compliance that support accountability and transparency.

(7) Federal AI systems require systematic integrity enforcement to maintain public trust and ensure safe operation.

---

## Section 3: Definitions

In this Act:

(a) **"Covered AI System"** means an artificial intelligence system that:
   (1) Is deployed by a federal agency; and
   (2) Affects more than 10,000 individuals; or
   (3) Makes or substantially informs decisions regarding:
      - Individual rights or benefits
      - Law enforcement or national security
      - Critical infrastructure
      - Public health or safety

(b) **"Governance Integrity Score" (GI Score)** means the composite measure of AI system compliance computed as:
```
GI = 0.25M + 0.20H + 0.30I + 0.25E
```
Where:
- M = Memory (test coverage, documentation quality)
- H = Human (code review, audit compliance)
- I = Integrity (security, pattern compliance)
- E = Ethics (charter alignment, virtue compliance)

(c) **"Multi-LLM Consensus"** means independent verification of system integrity by at least two distinct AI sentinel systems.

(d) **"Attestation"** means a cryptographically-secured record of compliance verification.

(e) **"Secretary"** means the Secretary of Commerce.

(f) **"Director"** means the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

## Section 4: AI Integrity Requirements

### (a) Minimum GI Score
