## Abstract

Traditional machine learning operates at the model level, optimizing parameters within fixed training distributions. Macro-Scale Machine Learning (MSML) proposes a paradigm shift: treating entire societies as trainable substrates where the "loss function" is civilizational entropy and the "gradient" flows through institutional feedback loops.

This paper formalizes the MSML framework, demonstrating how:
1. Societal institutions can be modeled as neural network layers
2. Collective behavior emerges from distributed gradient descent
3. Mobius Systems provides an implementation substrate

## Key Concepts

### Society as Neural Network

```
Input Layer     →  Individual intentions
Hidden Layers   →  Institutional processing
Output Layer    →  Collective outcomes
Loss Function   →  Civilizational entropy (S)
Optimizer       →  Strange Metamorphosis Loop
```

### The MSML Equation

```
dS/dt = -η∇L(S) + ε

Where:
  S = Societal state (entropy measure)
  L = Loss function (disorder cost)
  η = Learning rate (institutional adaptability)
  ε = Noise term (exogenous shocks)
```
