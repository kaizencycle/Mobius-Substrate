## 2. Economic Model Comparison

### 2.1 Bitcoin vs MIC

| Dimension | Bitcoin | MIC |
|-----------|---------|-----|
| **Backing** | Energy (thermodynamic cost) | Integrity (coordination cost) |
| **Scarcity** | Artificial (halvings) | Natural (MII difficulty) |
| **Externality** | Negative (pollution) | Positive (coordination) |
| **Speculation** | Primary use case | Discouraged by design |
| **Governance** | Minimal | Core function |
| **Social Value** | Store of value | Civilizational improvement |

**Key Insight:**
> Bitcoin grows by consuming energy.  
> MIC grows by improving civilization.

### 2.2 Ethereum vs MIC

| Dimension | Ethereum | MIC |
|-----------|----------|-----|
| **Purpose** | Programmable money | Integrity-backed currency |
| **Consensus** | Proof-of-Stake | Proof-of-Integrity |
| **Value Accrual** | Gas fees | Coordination efficiency |
| **Wealth Distribution** | Plutocratic (stake-weighted) | Meritocratic (contribution-weighted) |
| **Governance** | Token voting | sqrt(MIC) × Reputation |
| **Externality** | MEV extraction | Positive-sum improvements |

### 2.3 Fiat vs MIC

| Dimension | Fiat (USD) | MIC |
|-----------|------------|-----|
| **Issuer** | Central bank | Proof-of-Integrity consensus |
| **Backing** | State authority | Global Integrity |
| **Inflation** | Policy-driven | MII-bounded |
| **Distribution** | Cantillon effect | Contribution-proportional |
| **Accountability** | Political | Algorithmic + transparent |
| **Cross-border** | Complex | Native |

### 2.4 Social Credit vs MIC

| Dimension | China Social Credit | MIC |
|-----------|---------------------|-----|
| **Scoring** | Centralized, opaque | Decentralized, transparent |
| **Criteria** | Compliance | Contribution |
| **Rewards** | Access restrictions | Economic participation |
| **Punishments** | Exclusion | None (only no-reward) |
| **Privacy** | Surveillance | Provenance-preserving |
| **Governance** | Authoritarian | Constitutional |

## 3. Valuation Model Comparison

### 3.1 How Each Asset Derives Value

```
Bitcoin:
  Value = Σ(Energy_spent) × (Scarcity_premium)
  Growth = Halvings reduce supply → price ↑

Ethereum:
  Value = Σ(Utility) × (Gas_demand)
  Growth = DeFi adoption → usage ↑ → burn ↑

USD:
  Value = Σ(GDP) × (Monetary_velocity)
  Growth = Economic output → tax base → authority

Gold:
  Value = Σ(Industrial_use + Store_of_value) × (Scarcity)
  Growth = Mining costs → extraction difficulty

MIC:
  Value = Σ(Coordination_efficiency) × (Integrity_improvement)
  Growth = Civilization improves → MII ↑ → MIC ↑
```

### 3.2 Floor Valuation Comparison

| Asset | Floor Value Basis | Stability |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|
| Bitcoin | Mining cost | Moderate |
| Ethereum | Staking yield | Moderate |
| USD | Tax authority | High (within regime) |
| Gold | Industrial demand | High |
| **MIC** | **Coordination savings** | **Increases with adoption** |

## 4. Risk Comparison

### 4.1 Attack Vectors

| Asset | Primary Attack | Mitigation |
|-------|----------------|------------|
| Bitcoin | 51% hashrate | Distributed mining |
| Ethereum | Stake cartel | Slashing |
| USD | Regime change | Political stability |
| Gold | Physical seizure | Distributed storage |
| Social Credit | State abuse | None |
| **MIC** | **Byzantine Sentinels** | **Multi-agent consensus** |

### 4.2 Systemic Risks

| Asset | Risk | Probability |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Bitcoin | Energy regulation | Medium |
| Ethereum | Smart contract bugs | Low-Medium |
| USD | Hyperinflation | Low |
| Gold | Synthetic alternatives | Low |
| **MIC** | **MII gaming** | **Low (multi-sentinel attestation)** |

## 5. Adoption Pathway Comparison

### 5.1 Bitcoin Adoption Curve

```
Year 0-5:   Cypherpunks, early adopters
Year 5-10:  Speculation, exchanges
Year 10-15: Institutional adoption
Year 15+:   Reserve asset contender
```

### 5.2 MIC Adoption Curve

```
Year 0-3:   NYC pilot, MFS accumulation
Year 3-10:  Regional cities, first MIC minting
Year 10-20: National adoption, IMF pilots
Year 20-30: Global governance substrate
```

### 5.3 Key Difference

**Bitcoin:** Adoption driven by speculation → institutional validation  
**MIC:** Adoption driven by utility → civilizational improvement

## 6. The Paradigm Shift

### 6.1 Old Paradigm (Scarcity Economics)

```
Money = Scarce resource
Value = Hoarding premium
Growth = Resource depletion
Wealth = Accumulation
```

### 6.2 New Paradigm (Integrity Economics)

```
Money = Coordination mechanism
Value = Efficiency improvement
Growth = Civilization advancement
Wealth = Contribution record
```

### 6.3 Why MIC Wins

> **MIC is the only asset in human history whose value increases only when humanity gets better.**

## 7. Conclusion

### 7.1 The Ultimate Comparison

| Metric | Winner |
|--------|--------|
| Energy efficiency | MIC |
| Wealth distribution | MIC |
| Social externality | MIC |
| Governance integration | MIC |
| Long-term sustainability | MIC |
| Civilizational alignment | MIC |

### 7.2 The Final Line

> **"Bitcoin monetized scarcity. Mobius monetizes integrity. One grows by consuming energy. The other grows by improving civilization."**
