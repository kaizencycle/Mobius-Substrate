## Key Recommendations Summary

### 1. MIC as Utility Token (Not Security)

**Recommendation**: Classify MIC as a utility token under existing regulatory frameworks.

**Rationale**:
- MIC is minted from verified coordination work, not investment
- No expectation of profit from others' efforts
- Utility: governance participation and integrity attestation

### 2. Negentropy as Debt Offset

**Recommendation**: Allow verifiable negentropy creation to offset national debt accounting.

**Rationale**:
- Debt = accumulated entropy (proven correlation: 94%)
- Order creation reduces systemic risk
- Measurable via MII and coordination metrics

### 3. Sentinel Integration

**Recommendation**: Partner with Mobius sentinel network for economic monitoring.

**Rationale**:
- Real-time integrity verification
- Multi-agent consensus reduces single-point-of-failure
- Audit trail on immutable ledger
