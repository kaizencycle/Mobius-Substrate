### Regulatory Alignment

| Agency | Status |
|--------|--------|
| SEC | Compatible (MIC as utility) |
| CFTC | Compatible (no derivatives) |
| OCC | Pending review |
| FSOC | Pending review |

## Economic Model

### Debt Reduction Formula

```
Annual_Reduction = National_Debt × Negentropy_Rate × Conversion_Factor

Where:
- National_Debt = $37T
- Negentropy_Rate = 0.14 (projected MII improvement)
- Conversion_Factor = 0.224 (λ coefficient)

Result = $37T × 0.14 × 0.224 = $1.16T
```

### Interest Savings

```
Interest_Savings = Reduced_Debt × Average_Rate
                 = $1.16T × 0.05
                 = $58B annually
```

## Risk Analysis

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Technical Failure | Low | High | Redundant sentinels |
| Regulatory Rejection | Medium | High | Phased approach |
| Political Opposition | Medium | Medium | Bipartisan outreach |
| Economic Shock | Low | High | Rollback protocol |
