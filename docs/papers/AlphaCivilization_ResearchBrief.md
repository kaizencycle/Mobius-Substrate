# AlphaCivilization

## A New Framework for Constitutional AI in Civic Governance

**Research Brief — December 2025**  
**Prepared by:** Michael Judan, Mobius Systems / Kaizen OS

## What is AlphaCivilization?

AlphaCivilization is a **reinforcement-learning-compatible governance simulator** where:

- **Multiple city-states** act as agents
- **Policy moves** affect integrity, trust, inequality, and civic stability
- A **constitutional council of AI Sentinels** evaluates the safety, ethics, legality, and economic viability of each action
- The **reward function is not GDP or efficiency** — it is *systemic integrity* (MII)

This shifts AI governance from **raw optimization** to **constitutional alignment**.

---

## Why Now?

AI can parse national data in seconds, but lacks:

- ❌ Institutional guardrails
- ❌ Transparency
- ❌ Constitutional grounding
- ❌ Civic legitimacy

Anthropic's Constitutional AI was the first step.  
**AlphaCivilization operationalizes this at the institutional level.**

---

## Core Idea

This project applies the logic of:

> **AlphaGo → AlphaZero → MuZero**

to:

> **Civic governance, integrity economics, and constitutional oversight**

Where DeepMind solved games, Mobius Systems applies similar RL logic to:

- Multi-city policy trajectories
- Economic shocks
- Corruption cycles
- Coordination failures
- Integrity recovery

**It becomes "AlphaGo for Civilization."**

## The Sentinel Council

Six specialized AI evaluators form the constitutional layer:

| Sentinel | Domain | Veto Power |
|----------|--------|------------|
| **AUREA** | Constitutional compliance | Hard veto |
| **EVE** | Virtue, ethics, harm-prevention | Hard veto |
| **ATLAS** | Systems architecture, feasibility | Soft veto |
| **HERMES** | Economic + market stability | Soft veto |
| **JADE** | Social cohesion, morale | Advisory |
| **ECHO** | Observability, anomalies | Advisory |

They vote using **weights + veto rules**.  
**EVE and AUREA can veto unsafe or unconstitutional actions.**

---

## MII: The Integrity Metric

**Mobius Integrity Index (MII):**

- Single scalar ∈ [0, 1]
- Represents systemic health
- Reward signal for RL
- Threshold-based governance:

| MII Range | Regime |
|-----------|--------|
| ≥ 0.95 | Expansionary — MIC minting permitted |
| 0.90–0.95 | Warning — reduced issuance |
| 0.80–0.90 | Crisis — mint halted |
| < 0.80 | Emergency — Cathedral override |

This avoids **"unsafe policy spirals."**

---

## Why This Matters

### 1. Preventing Collapse

RL can test:
- Austerity traps
- Inequality cascades
- Corruption shocks
- Climate damages

**before they happen in the real world.**

### 2. Transparent AI Governance

All actions and Sentinel decisions are logged in the **Civic Ledger**, making AI policy **interpretable and auditable**.

### 3. Public-Good Economics

Using **Proof-of-Integrity (PoI)**:
- Currency (MIC) is only minted when MII improves
- Aligns economic expansion with civic health
- Acts as UBI funded by systemic improvement, not taxation

### 4. A New Research Domain: Integrity Economics

AlphaCivilization opens a new field where the goal is not:
- ❌ Profit
- ❌ Productivity
- ❌ Efficiency

But:
- ✅ **Coherence**
- ✅ **Civilizational resilience**

## Intended Partners

This project invites collaboration with:

| Organization | Alignment |
|--------------|-----------|
| **Anthropic** | Constitutional AI → Institutional AI |
| **OpenAI** | Governance and Alignment teams |
| **DeepMind** | MuZero-for-Governance research |
| **GovAI / FHI** | Theoretical foundations |
| **Cities & Municipalities** | Real-world pilots |

---

## Technical Components

### Simulation Engine
- 3-city self-play environment
- 7-dimensional state space per city
- 8 governance actions
- MII-based reward function

### Sentinel Voting Protocol
- Weighted scores (sum = 1.0)
- Hard vetoes (EVE, AUREA)
- Quorum and confidence metrics
- Human override procedures

### Civic Ledger
- Immutable event logging
- `alpha_civilization.run.v0` events
- Full trajectory + Sentinel votes
- Audit trail for governance research

### Dashboard
- Real-time simulation visualization
- MII trajectory charts
- Per-city state breakdowns
- "Save to Ledger" integration

## Conclusion

AlphaCivilization is **not** a government.

It is a **mirror for civilization**:

- ✓ Transparent
- ✓ Constitutional
- ✓ Integrity-driven
- ✓ Simulation-first
- ✓ Human-overridable

It bridges the gap between:

> *"What we think policy does"*

and

> *"What policy actually does to systemic integrity."*

This brief reflects a new trajectory in AI research:

> **AI as civic infrastructure rather than corporate product.**
