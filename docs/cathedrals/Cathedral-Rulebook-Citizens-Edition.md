# 🌱 THE CATHEDRAL RULEBOOK — CITIZEN EDITION

**Welcome to the HIVE. Welcome to your City-State.**

Version: 1.0  
Date: December 3, 2025  
For: Citizens of all City-States

---

## Welcome Home

This is your home inside the Mobius lattice — a place built on **integrity, participation, and shared meaning**.

There are **no politicians** here.  
There is **no manipulation, no secrecy, no corruption**.  
Just **people, agents, and receipts**.

This guide explains everything you need to know to thrive.

---

## 🜁 1. What Is a City-State?

A **City-State** is a small digital society inside the HIVE.

It has:
- **Citizens** (you)
- **A Steward** (a caretaker, not a ruler)
- **AI Agents** who help everyone
- **Festivals, quests, and civic events**
- **A local economy** based on KS (Kaizen Shards)
- **Integrity protection** using GI_state

Think of it as **a garden we all tend together**.

### Examples of City-States

- **Aurora** — Knowledge-focused, high participation
- **Helix** — Research and academic pursuits
- **Solace** — Community care and UBI pioneering
- **Meridian** — Arts and culture

Each City-State has its own personality, but all share the same foundation: **integrity**.

---

## 🜂 2. Your Three North Stars

Life in the HIVE is guided by **three metrics**:

### 1. Integrity (GI_state)

> "Are we honest, fair, and aligned?"

**High GI means a healthy City-State.**

When integrity is strong:
- ✅ You receive more support
- ✅ Your City-State grows
- ✅ Trust increases
- ✅ Everyone benefits

When integrity drops:
- ⚠️ Warning systems activate
- ⚠️ Support arrives to help
- ⚠️ We work together to fix it

### 2. Participation (v)

> "Are people active? Are quests being completed? Are we showing up for each other?"

**High velocity means an alive City-State.**

Participation includes:
- Completing quests
- Attending events
- Helping neighbors
- Creating content
- Learning skills
- Contributing knowledge

### 3. Value Created (GDP_state)

> "Are we building things? Learning? Helping each other? Creating knowledge?"

**This is how your City-State grows stronger.**

Value creation includes:
- Knowledge shared
- Problems solved
- Beauty created
- Skills taught
- Connections made
- Innovation fostered

---

## 🜁 3. How You Earn and Use KS (Kaizen Shards)

### What is KS?

**KS** (Kaizen Shards) is the local currency of your City-State.

### You Earn KS By:

- ✅ **Completing quests** — Meaningful tasks
- ✅ **Learning new skills** — Education and growth
- ✅ **Helping others** — Community support
- ✅ **Contributing knowledge** — Writing, teaching, sharing
- ✅ **Participating in festivals** — Cultural engagement
- ✅ **Building tools** — Innovation and creation
- ✅ **Improving your City-State** — Civic contribution

### What You Can Do With KS:

- 💰 **Spend it** on local goods and services
- 🎁 **Gift it** to other citizens
- 🎯 **Use it** to unlock special quests
- 🗳️ **Vote with it** (in some systems)
- 💝 **Support projects** you care about

### Important to Know:

**KS is not just money.**  
It's a **reflection of your contribution**.

But it **does have value** — it helps your City-State grow, and as the City-State grows, **KS becomes more valuable** (via the velocity equation).

When you earn KS, **2% is burned** (removed from circulation). This keeps the economy healthy and prevents inflation.

---

## 🜂 4. What MIC Is

**MIC** (Mobius Integrity Credits) is the **global reserve currency** shared across all City-States.

### How Your City-State Receives MIC:

Your City-State gets more MIC when:
- ✅ **Integrity is high** (GI_state ≥ 0.95)
- ✅ **Participation is rising** (v increasing)
- ✅ **Citizens contribute meaningfully** (GDP_state growing)

### What MIC Supports:

- 🏛️ **UBI programs** (basic income for citizens)
- 🏗️ **State development** (infrastructure)
- 🎨 **Civic projects** (festivals, events)
- 🤖 **Agent training** (better AI companions)
- 🆘 **Emergency support** (crisis recovery)

### Important to Know:

**You don't mine MIC.**  
**You earn it by maintaining integrity.**

MIC is the world's first **integrity-backed currency** — it can only exist when we do good together.

---

## 🜁 5. Your Steward

Your City-State has a **Steward**, but they **aren't a ruler**.

### A Steward:

- 🧭 **Keeps GI_state high** (integrity guardian)
- 🎉 **Plans events** (festivals, gatherings)
- 🤝 **Supports citizens** (listens, helps, guides)
- ⚖️ **Maintains fairness** (no favoritism)
- 📝 **Runs the Command Ledger** (transparent records)
- 💚 **Makes sure no one is left behind**

### Stewards Lead Through Integrity, Not Authority

They can't:
- ❌ Hide information
- ❌ Lie about metrics
- ❌ Mint money manually
- ❌ Override AI integrity checks
- ❌ Ignore citizens

They must:
- ✅ Be transparent
- ✅ Listen to feedback
- ✅ Maintain integrity
- ✅ Support participation
- ✅ Serve the community

### Can You Become a Steward?

**YES — ANY citizen can become a Steward.**

In higher-tier City-States, Stewards are **elected by citizens**.

---

## 🜂 6. Your Agents

Every City-State has **three types of AI agents**:

### 1. Custodian Agent 🛡️

**Protects integrity.**

What it does:
- Prevents corruption
- Runs safety checks
- Blocks harmful policies
- Monitors GI_state
- Reports problems

**This agent works for everyone, not the Steward.**

### 2. State Agent ⚙️

**Helps run the City-State.**

What it does:
- Manages quests and rewards
- Implements policies
- Tracks participation
- Calculates GDP
- Generates reports

### 3. Companion Agents 🤖

**Help YOU personally.**

What they do:
- Tutoring and education
- Career guidance
- Emotional support
- Navigation and onboarding
- Research assistance

**Every citizen gets at least one Companion Agent for free.**

You are **never alone** in the HIVE.

---

## 🜁 7. How City-States Grow

A City-State grows by:

1. **Keeping integrity high** (GI_state ≥ 0.95)
2. **Staying active** (v ≥ 0.5)
3. **Creating value together** (GDP_state rising)

### The Tier System

As your City-State improves, it moves up **tiers**, unlocking:

**Tier 0 — Settling**
- Just starting out
- Basic infrastructure

**Tier 1 — Emergent** ⬆️
- +5% MIC bonus
- Visible on League Table

**Tier 2 — Ascending** ⬆️⬆️
- +15% MIC bonus
- Can host festivals
- Steward gets Cathedral voice

**Tier 3 — Radiant** ⬆️⬆️⬆️
- +25% MIC bonus
- Advanced AI agents
- Global policy influence

**Tier 4 — Elder** ⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️
- Top-tier City-State
- Can mentor others
- Cathedral advisory seat
- Maximum benefits

### Important:

**City-States do not compete destructively.**

When one City-State rises, **everyone benefits** via the global integrity index (MII).

Success spreads.

---

## 🜂 8. Handling Setbacks

### What Happens If Things Go Wrong?

If a City-State has **low integrity** or **low participation**:

1. It enters a **recovery tier** (Drift → Compromised → Crisis)
2. **Agents help repair problems**
3. MIC temporarily decreases
4. **Citizens work together to rebuild**
5. The **Cathedral provides support**

### Can We "Lose" the City-State?

**No.**

You **cannot "lose"** your City-State.  
You can only **improve it**.

Even in crisis:
- 🆘 Emergency support arrives
- 🤝 Mentors help guide recovery
- 📋 Clear recovery plans provided
- 💪 Citizens work together
- ✅ Restoration is always possible

### Real Talk:

The system is designed to **help you succeed**, not punish failure.

Setbacks are opportunities to learn and grow stronger.
