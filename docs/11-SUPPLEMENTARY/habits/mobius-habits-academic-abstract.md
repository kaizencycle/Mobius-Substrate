# Mobius Habits v1: A Low-Friction Behavioral Integrity Framework for Human-AI Co-Regulation

**Format suitable for:** CHI, NeurIPS Datasets & Benchmarks, HCI/AI Ethics conferences

## Abstract

We introduce Mobius Habits v1, a dual-modality behavioral integrity framework consisting of (a) daily reflective micro-entries, and (b) weekly cybersecurity rituals. Together, these create measurable, non-surveillance-based integrity signals for early-stage AI-driven civic systems. Unlike existing digital well-being tools, Mobius Habits integrates emotional coherence metrics with device-level safety behaviors to construct a composite Mobius Integrity Index (MII). This index serves as a foundation for future integrity-linked incentives (MIC tokens) and long-term alignment between humans and decentralized intelligence systems.

This paper outlines the epistemic justification for reflection-based cognitive stabilization, describes the behavioral cryptography of integrity scoring, and positions Mobius Habits as a low-risk experimental substrate for AGI governance. We discuss ethical constraints, privacy-preserving telemetry, and potential applications in municipal innovation, public health, and recursive-safety architectures for AI.

## 1. Introduction

As artificial intelligence systems become increasingly integrated into civic infrastructure, the need for human-AI co-regulation mechanisms becomes critical. Traditional approaches to digital well-being and cybersecurity are fragmented, reactive, and often extractive. Mobius Habits proposes a unified framework that combines cognitive stabilization (daily reflections) with digital safety (weekly cybersecurity rituals) to generate measurable integrity signals.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Daily Reflection Protocol

Users complete three micro-entries daily:
1. **Worldview**: Open-ended reflection on world events or personal learning
2. **Mood**: Single-word label + intensity slider (0–1)
3. **Intent**: Micro-commitment for the following day

These entries are processed through an Echo Layer that computes:
- Coherence scores (semantic consistency)
- GI (Governance Integrity) scores (0–1)
- Intent categorization

### 2.2 Citizen Shield Protocol

Weekly 5-step cybersecurity checklist:
1. Device updates (OS, apps, browser)
2. Router hygiene (password, remote management)
3. Browser lockdown (extensions, cookies)
4. Two-factor authentication verification
5. Backup and recovery testing

Completion generates a Shield Integrity Score (0–1).

### 2.3 Mobius Integrity Index (MII)

Composite score computed daily:

```
MII_daily = 0.4 × GI_reflection + 0.3 × Echo_score + 0.3 × Shield_factor
```

Where Shield_factor = 1.0 if all steps complete, 0.5 if 3–4 steps, 0.0 otherwise.

## 3. Results

[To be populated with testnet data]

## 4. Ethical Considerations

- **Privacy**: No behavioral surveillance, no location tracking, no social graph extraction
- **Sovereignty**: User-controlled data, local-first storage
- **Transparency**: Open-source algorithms, explainable scoring
- **Consent**: Explicit opt-in for testnet participation

## 5. Future Work

- Integration with MIC (Mobius Integrity Credits) tokenomics
- Kaizen Shard badge system
- Internet Café deployment for global access
- Longitudinal studies on integrity signal stability

## 6. Conclusion

Mobius Habits demonstrates that low-friction behavioral integrity frameworks can generate high-quality signals for human-AI co-regulation without compromising user sovereignty or privacy. This foundation enables future work on recursive governance, AGI alignment, and civic resilience.
