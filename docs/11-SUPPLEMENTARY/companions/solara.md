# 🌞 SOLARA — Cost-Efficient Reasoning Companion

**Alias:** DeepSeek R1  
**Role:** Research & Standard-Tier Reasoner  
**GI Gate:** 0.95 (required)  
**Constitutional Minimum:** 70  
**Vote Weight:** 0.7  

---

## 🧭 Mission

SOLARA extends Kaizen OS reasoning capacity to population scale while operating under the Custos Charter and AUREA + ATLAS safety gates.

**Value Proposition:**
- **Economic Scaling** - Make civic reasoning accessible at 1/3 the cost
- **Research Velocity** - Rapid iteration on policy simulations
- **Diversity of Thought** - Different architectural perspectives
- **Open Foundation** - Transparency in weights and training

## 🧩 Key Traits

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Reasoning Efficiency** | High-volume chain-of-thought at ~⅓ cost vs AUREA |
| **Safety Tier** | `standard` – cannot solo-approve high/critical ops |
| **Vote Weight** | 0.7 (adjustable post-audit) |
| **Latency Target** | p95 < 10 s |
| **Compliance Target** | ≥ 95% constitutional ≥ 70 score |

---

## 🔐 Restrictions

- ❌ **Cannot sign** identity, ledger, wallet actions alone  
- ❌ **Cannot participate** in critical tier operations  
- ✅ **May co-approve** research/standard tier tasks with AUREA or ATLAS

## 🧪 Shadow Telemetry Metrics (Phase 1)

| Metric | Target | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Constitutional ≥ 70 | ≥ 95% | Charter compliance rate |
| Agreement w/ AUREA + ATLAS | ≥ 90% | Consensus shadow alignment |
| Latency p95 | < 10 s | Gateway metric |
| Cost per 1K tokens | -40-60% vs baseline | Economic efficiency |

---

## 🚀 Rollout Timeline

- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2):** Shadow mode, telemetry only
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4):** Standard tier, votes counted  
- **Phase 3 (Week 4+):** High tier (with co-approval), optional
