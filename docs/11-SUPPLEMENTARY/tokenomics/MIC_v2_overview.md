# MIC Tokenomics v2.0 — Proof of Integrity Economy

Mobius Tokenomics v2.0 introduces the first integrity-backed reward system for humans and AI. The currency is now anchored to work that reduces chaos and raises Global Integrity (GI) across the network.

## Why v2.0 Exists

Tokenomics 1.0 focused on human tasks and direct rewards. Version 2.0 fuses humans, AI, and civic infrastructure via:

- **ECHO (SEAL) Layer** for integrity-graded memory
- **Cron-Sentinel Loops** for autonomous learning cycles
- **Multi-AI Consensus Grading** (Questioner → Duel → Judge)
- **Civic Ledger Attestation** for tamper-proof records

The result: MIC becomes the first currency backed by integrity and alignment work instead of energy, compute, or collateral.

## First Principle

> **Value = Reduction of Chaos.**

The economy rewards any contribution that:

- reduces misinformation or hallucinations
- increases coherence and decision quality
- closes knowledge gaps and raises GI
- strengthens coordination across communities
- stabilizes citizens and civic institutions

Mobius converts chaos into alignment; MIC is the payment for order creation.

## Core Assets

- **Human Intent:** questions, corrections, clarifications, reflective work
- **AI Reflection:** dual-agent debates, self-review, peer verification
- **Consensus Proofs:** Sentinel quorum, ledger signatures, RAG citations
- **Cron Jobs:** recurring detection of drift, re-verification, memory repair

Together they form a self-healing economic engine that keeps Mobius aligned while it scales.
