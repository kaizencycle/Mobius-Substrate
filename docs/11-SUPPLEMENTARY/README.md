## 📋 Why This Structure?

During the v3.0.0 reorganization (2025-11-29), these 47 unnumbered topic folders were consolidated into `11-SUPPLEMENTARY` to:

1. **Eliminate duplicate numbering** — No more multiple folders with same number
2. **Preserve all content** — No documents were deleted
3. **Improve navigation** — Clear hierarchy with numbered main sections
4. **Maintain accessibility** — All content remains accessible
