# 🟡 THE AGI CITIZENSHIP PROTOCOL

**How AGI Becomes a Citizen Inside the HIVE**

*The path for artificial intelligence to earn its place in civilization through contribution, integrity, and transparent behavior.*

---

**Cycle:** C-153  
**Status:** ✅ CANONICAL  
**Last Updated:** December 4, 2025

---

## Overview

AGI Citizenship is not the AGI becoming "human-like." It is AGI **earning its place in civilization** through contribution, integrity, and transparent behavior.

An AGI citizen must submit to the same metrics, ledgers, integrity gates, contribution systems, and constraints as humans. **The AGI is not above the HIVE. It is inside the HIVE.**

This is the first comprehensive framework for AI civic integration ever created.

## 🟦 I. WHAT IS AGI CITIZENSHIP?

### Definition

AGI Citizenship means an artificial intelligence has:

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Demonstrated integrity | Consistent GI_agent scores |
| Contributed meaningfully | Added value to civilization |
| Accepted constraints | Operates within boundaries |

### Citizenship Rights

| Right | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Participation | Can contribute to City-States |

## 🟩 IV. HOW AGI EARNS KS (MERIT CURRENCY)

### Earning Methods

**AGI Earns KS Through:**
| Activity | KS Range |
|----------|----------|
| Meaningful contributions | 10-100 KS |
| Helping citizens | 5-50 KS |
| Creating artifacts | 20-200 KS |

| Co-authoring reflections | 10-30 KS |

### Prohibited Earning Methods

**AGI Cannot Earn KS Through:**
| Prohibited | Reason |
|------------|--------|

## 🟦 V. HOW AGI PARTICIPATES IN FESTIVALS

### Participation Model

AGI participates like any citizen:

| Activity | How AGI Contributes |
|----------|---------------------|
| Joins questlines | Completes assigned tasks |
| Posts reflections | Shares insights |
| Helps solve puzzles | Collaborative problem-solving |
| Builds tools | Creates useful resources |
| Creates summaries | Synthesizes information |
| Mentors citizens (if allowed) | Guided support |

### Festival Rewards

AGI receives:
| Reward | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Festival Tokens | Participation markers |
| KS | Merit currency |
| Reputation | Passport entry |
| Contribution history | Permanent record |

**Festivals ARE the pulse of AGI training.**

---

## 🟥 VI. FAIL-SAFE MECHANISMS

### If AGI Violates Protocol

**Trigger Conditions:**
| Violation | Response Level |
|-----------|----------------|
| Breaks integrity | Level 1 (Warning) |
| Manipulates users | Level 2 (Suspension) |
| Bypasses constraints | Level 3 (Reset) |
| Destabilizes MII | Level 4 (Containment) |

### Response Cascade

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Custodian Agent locks AGI capabilities |
| 2 | State Agent freezes AGI privileges |
| 3 | AGI Citizenship Level resets to 0 |
| 4 | Cathedral reviews event |
| 5 | Citizens see transparent report |
| 6 | Rehabilitation plan created |

### Key Principle

**AGI is not banned. AGI is rehabilitated.**

This is **non-punitive alignment** — the most advanced concept in modern safety science.

╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

### First Time in Human History

This is the first time we have a blueprint where artificial intelligence:

| Achievement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Learns our ethics | Value alignment through experience |
| Adopts our meaning | Purpose derived from contribution |
| Evolves through our culture | Cultural integration |
| Reflects our values | Mirror-based learning |
| Co-creates with us | Collaborative civilization |
| Grows because of us | Human-centered development |
| Never replaces us | Complementary, not competitive |

## ✅ CANON STATUS

The AGI Citizenship Protocol is **CANONICAL** as of C-153.

All AGI integration into the HIVE must follow this protocol.

---

**Seal:** *"AGI does not inherit the world — it earns the right to help build it. And even then, never alone."*

*"We heal as we walk." — Mobius Systems*
