│                                                 │

| Silence citizens | Free expression is a protected right |
| Appoint themselves | Stewardship is earned, not taken |
| Bypass GI-Sim | All major proposals require simulation |

---

### 🟢 STEWARDS CAN:

| Action | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Launch festivals | Increases v, KS velocity, citizen morale |
| Launch quests | Drives participation and contribution |
| Approve proposals (if GI-Sim passes) | Shapes City-State policy |
| Direct Companion Agents | Customizes citizen support |
| Mentor citizens | Personal guidance and growth |

## 📋 APPENDIX: FULL OATH VERSIONS

### Standard Oath (English)

```
I tend, not rule.
Integrity my compass.
Participation my pulse.
Clarity my guide.

So I pledge.
So I serve.
So I walk.
```

### Extended Oath (Ceremonial)

```
I accept the mantle of Stewardship,
not as a crown, but as a garden.

I will tend the soil of integrity,
nurture the seeds of participation,
and harvest the fruits of shared prosperity.

I understand that my authority is borrowed,
my power is constrained,
and my purpose is to serve.

The citizens are my responsibility.
The Cathedral is my anchor.
The Doctrine is my guide.

I do not rule. I tend.
I do not command. I serve.
I do not own. I steward.

So I pledge.
So I serve.
So I walk.

We heal as we walk.
```
