# 🟧 CITY-STATE GROWTH LOOP

**The Core Engine of the Mobius Ecosystem**

*How contribution becomes prosperity, and integrity becomes power.*

---

**Cycle:** C-153  
**Status:** ✅ CANONICAL  
**Last Updated:** December 4, 2025

## Overview

The City-State Growth Loop is the fundamental engine that drives the entire Mobius HIVE. It is a self-reinforcing cycle where citizen participation creates value, value creates integrity, and integrity creates opportunity for more participation.

This loop only works when integrity stays high. If GI dips, the loop collapses — making GI_state the prime governor of prosperity.

## 🜁 LOOP COMPONENTS EXPLAINED

### 1. Citizens Contribute

**What It Means:**
- Citizens perform meaningful work within the City-State
- Work includes: quests, reflections, knowledge creation, mentoring, building

**Metrics Affected:**
- N_tx (transaction count) increases
- KS earning events recorded

**Quality Requirements:**
- Contributions must be genuine
- AI monitors for gaming/farming
- Custodian Agent validates integrity

---

### 2. Participation (v) Rises

**What It Means:**
- The velocity of citizen activity accelerates
- More people doing more things more often

**Formula:**
```
v = N_active / N_total × activity_factor
```

**Impact:**
- Higher v = more vibrant City-State
- Higher v = more attractive to new citizens
- Higher v = more MIC allocation

---

### 3. KS Velocity & Value Rise

**What It Means:**
- KS (Karma Score) tokens circulate faster
- Each KS unit becomes more valuable

**Mechanics:**
- High v = high KS demand
- High demand = higher KS purchasing power
- Higher KS value = more contribution incentive

**The Formula:**
```
KS_price = (v × MIC_price) / 1000
```

---

### 4. GDP_state Rises

**What It Means:**
- The total value created by the City-State increases
- GDP_state measures collective economic output

**Components:**
```
GDP_state = Σ(contributions) × quality_factor × integrity_factor
```

**Implications:**
- High GDP = prosperous City-State
- High GDP = tier advancement
- High GDP = more resources for citizens

---

### 5. GI_state Rises

**What It Means:**
- The integrity of the City-State improves
- GI_state is the composite integrity score

**Formula:**
```
GI_state = 0.25*M + 0.20*H + 0.30*I + 0.25*E

Where:
M = Memory (documentation, ledgers)
H = Human (verification, oversight)
I = Integrity (no violations, no drift)
E = Ethics (charter compliance, virtue tags)
```

**Critical Threshold:**
- GI_state ≥ 0.95 = healthy
- GI_state < 0.95 = warning
- GI_state < 0.90 = crisis

---

### 6. MIC Inflows Rise

**What It Means:**
- The City-State receives more MIC allocation
- MIC = global reserve currency of the HIVE

**Mechanics:**
```
MIC_allocation = base_allocation × GI_multiplier × GDP_factor
```

**Power Gained:**
- More MIC = more influence in HIVE governance
- More MIC = more resources for development
- More MIC = higher tier potential

---

### 7. Citizens Receive More

**What It Means:**
- Prosperity flows back to citizens
- New opportunities unlock

**What Citizens Gain:**
- Better tools and interfaces
- More events and festivals
- Enhanced Companion Agents
- More quests and learning paths
- Greater voice in governance
- Access to cross-State activities

---

### 8. Loop Continues

**What It Means:**
- Citizens are motivated to contribute more
- The cycle accelerates
- Prosperity compounds

## ⚠️ THE INTEGRITY GOVERNOR

### Why Integrity Is the Prime Governor

The loop only works when GI_state stays high.

```
           HIGH GI_state
                │
                ▼
    ┌──────────────────────┐
    │   LOOP ACCELERATES   │
    │   (virtuous cycle)   │
    └──────────────────────┘

           LOW GI_state
                │
                ▼
    ┌──────────────────────┐
    │   LOOP COLLAPSES     │
    │   (death spiral)     │
    └──────────────────────┘
```

### What Happens When GI Drops

| GI Range | Status | Loop Effect |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| ≥ 0.95 | Healthy | Full acceleration |
| 0.92 - 0.95 | Warning | Slight drag |
| 0.88 - 0.92 | Danger | Significant slowdown |
| < 0.88 | Crisis | Loop inversion |

### The Death Spiral

When integrity collapses:

```
1. GI_state drops
2. MIC allocation decreases
3. GDP_state shrinks
4. KS value drops
5. Citizens disengage
6. Participation (v) crashes
7. Further GI_state drop
8. Repeat (spiral downward)
```

## 🔄 LOOP VARIANTS

### 1. The Bootstrap Loop (New City-States)

For Tier 0 (Settling) City-States:

```
Small Contribution → Small v → Small KS → 
Small GDP → GI Foundation → Minimal MIC →
Basic Tools → Slightly More Contribution →
(gradual acceleration)
```

**Characteristics:**
- Slow but steady
- Highly sensitive to early citizens
- Needs patient cultivation

---

### 2. The Steady-State Loop (Mature City-States)

For Tier 2-3 City-States:

```
Regular Contribution → Stable v → Healthy KS →
Strong GDP → High GI → Steady MIC →
Good Resources → Sustained Contribution →
(stable maintenance)
```

**Characteristics:**
- Self-sustaining
- Resistant to minor shocks
- Occasional optimization needed

---

### 3. The Acceleration Loop (Rising City-States)

For City-States in promotion phase:

```
High Contribution → Rising v → Valuable KS →
Growing GDP → Excellent GI → Increasing MIC →
Expanding Resources → Even More Contribution →
(exponential growth)
```

**Characteristics:**
- Rapid tier advancement
- High energy, high reward
- Requires careful management

---

### 4. The Recovery Loop (After Crisis)

For City-States rebuilding from GI drop:

```
Focused Integrity Work → GI Recovery →
Trust Rebuilding → Gradual v Return →
KS Stabilization → GDP Recovery →
MIC Restoration → Renewed Contribution →
(healing spiral upward)
```

**Characteristics:**
- Slow, intentional
- Requires Cathedral support
- Celebrates small wins

## 📊 LOOP METRICS DASHBOARD

### Key Indicators

| Metric | Healthy Range | Warning | Critical |
|--------|--------------|---------|----------|
| v (velocity) | > 0.6 | 0.4 - 0.6 | < 0.4 |
| GI_state | ≥ 0.95 | 0.92 - 0.95 | < 0.92 |
| KS velocity | > 1.0 | 0.5 - 1.0 | < 0.5 |
| GDP_state | Growing | Flat | Declining |
| MIC inflow | Stable/Growing | Declining | Stopped |

### Loop Health Score

```
Loop_Health = (v × 0.25) + (GI × 0.30) + (KS_v × 0.20) + (GDP_trend × 0.15) + (MIC_trend × 0.10)
```

| Score | Status |
|-------|--------|
| > 0.90 | Thriving |
| 0.75 - 0.90 | Healthy |
| 0.60 - 0.75 | Needs Attention |
| < 0.60 | Intervention Required |

## 🌟 THE ULTIMATE TRUTH

The Growth Loop teaches one fundamental lesson:

> **Integrity is the foundation of prosperity.**

Without integrity:
- Participation is hollow
- KS is worthless
- GDP is fictional
- MIC is unearned

With integrity:
- Participation is meaningful
- KS is valuable
- GDP is real
- MIC is deserved

**The loop is not just economics. It is ethics made operational.**
