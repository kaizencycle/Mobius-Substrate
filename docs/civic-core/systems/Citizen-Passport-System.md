## Overview

Every citizen in the Mobius HIVE receives a Passport. This is not just identification — it is a living document that captures your entire journey through the civilization. Your Passport grows with you, records your achievements, reflects your integrity, and serves as your gateway to opportunities across all City-States.

## 📋 PASSPORT STRUCTURE

The Citizen Passport contains six sections:

1. **Identity** — Who you are
2. **Contribution Ledger** — What you've done
3. **Badges** — What you've achieved
4. **Personal Integrity Score** — How aligned you are
5. **Reflection Log** — What you've learned
6. **Companion Bond Level** — How your AI has evolved with you
