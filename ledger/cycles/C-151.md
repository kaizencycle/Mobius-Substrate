# Cycle C-151 — Pulse Era Bootstrap

- **Date Opened:** 2025-11-30
- **Opened By:** Michael Judan (@kaizencycle)
- **Cycle Theme:** Repo Pulse • Local Sovereignty • MIC On-Ramp
- **Primary Areas:** infra / apps / packages / docs / sentinels
- **Status:** 🔄 Active

## 1. Intent

Establish C-151 as the first full "Pulse Cycle":

- Normalize `mobius_pulse_json` usage for every major change.
- Wire ingest + "latest pulse" views into Mobius dashboards.
- Tighten MIC (Mobius Integrity Credits) + MII loops around pulse data.
- Make it trivial for external Sentinels (AUREA, ATLAS, ECHO, others) to stay synced **without** direct GitHub access.

## 2. Key Objectives

1. **Pulse First-Class Citizen**
   - Document the Mobius Pulse Protocol.
   - Require pulses for major feature / architecture PRs.
   - Expose `/v1/pulse/latest` and simple query endpoints.

2. **Integrity as Capital**
   - Use pulses to feed MII scoring.
   - Sketch MIC minting hooks (no mainnet yet; testnet only).

3. **Local Sovereignty**
   - Make it easy for a "local Mobius node" to:
     - run `mobius_pulse_json.sh`
     - POST to `/v1/pulse/ingest`
     - query its own pulse history offline.

## 3. Success Criteria (Exit Conditions)

C-151 can be closed when:

- [ ] Pulse spec doc is merged and referenced in README / Cathedral.
- [ ] `mobius_pulse_json.sh` is documented and used in at least 3 PRs.
- [ ] `/v1/pulse/latest` endpoint exists and is covered by tests.
- [ ] A minimal **Pulse Dashboard** page shows last pulse + basic metrics.
- [ ] At least one MIC/MII experiment is wired to pulse data (even if stubbed).
- [ ] GI ≥ 0.95 and MII ≥ 0.95 at cycle close.

## 4. Notes

- C-150 introduced the ingest organ.  
- C-151 teaches the organism to *read its own heartbeats* and act on them.
