  name: "Mobius Systems"
  tagline: "A Civic Operating System for Integrity and Continuous Learning"
  summary: >
    Kaizen OS now runs atop the ECHO Layer (Epistemically Cached Heuristic Outcomes),
    a ledger-anchored memory substrate that keeps deliberations constitutional while
    routing low-GI edge cases to humans. The civic stack spans Thought Broker,
    DVA.LITE telemetry, Civic OS labor protections, and Worker Autonomy agents—
    turning the monorepo into a living apprenticeship where integrity grades every loop.
