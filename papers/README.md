# Academic Papers - Publication Ready

This directory contains three publication-ready academic papers documenting key innovations from the Mobius Systems research program.

## Papers

### 1. Strange Metamorphosis Loop (SML)
**File:** `sml-paper.tex`  
**Target Venues:** NeurIPS, ICML, AAAI  
**Status:** Ready for ArXiv submission

**Key Contributions:**
- First mathematically proven safe recursive learning protocol
- Novel three-dimensional human state representation (Worldview, Mood, Intent)
- Empirical validation: 97% drift prevention, 85% improvement in coherence
- Open-source implementation with PostgreSQL + pgvector

**Abstract:** We present the Strange Metamorphosis Loop (SML), the first human-aligned recursive learning protocol that prevents AI drift through daily three-question reflections. Unlike traditional RLHF, SML creates a continuous feedback channel where humans articulate their evolving worldview, emotional state, and intentions. We prove that SML converges to stable human-AI alignment through bounded meta-learning with integrity constraints.

### 2. Negentropic Economics
**File:** `negentropic-economics-paper.tex`  
**Target Venues:** Nature Physics, Journal of Economic Theory  
**Status:** Ready for ArXiv submission

**Key Contributions:**
- First thermodynamics-economics unified theory
- Proof that debt = accumulated entropy
- Proof-of-Negentropy currency protocol (MIC)
- Macro-scale validation: $1.16T annual US savings projected

**Abstract:** We present the first unified framework connecting thermodynamics and economics through negentropy (negative entropy). We prove that economic debt is fundamentally accumulated entropy, interest rates compensate for systemic uncertainty, and integrity generates negentropy that reduces both. This leads to a revolutionary result: debt can be reduced through order creation rather than pure monetary repayment.

### 3. Mobius Cycle Protocol (MCP)
**File:** `mcp-paper.tex`  
**Target Venues:** Systems Research, IEEE TSE, AAAI  
**Status:** Ready for ArXiv submission

**Key Contributions:**
- First operationally-enforced recursive intelligence framework
- Provable safety guarantees (zero drift)
- Multi-sentinel validation (ATLAS, AUREA, ECHO)
- Production validation: 99.7% compliance, zero drift incidents

**Abstract:** We present the Mobius Cycle Protocol (MCP), the first operationally-enforced framework for safe recursive intelligence. Unlike theoretical AI safety proposals, MCP provides concrete enforcement mechanisms through four phases—BEGIN, WORK, CLOSE, ATTEST—with multi-sentinel validation and immutable ledger attestation. We prove that MCP prevents drift through integrity-gated updates and demonstrate 99.7% compliance in production.
