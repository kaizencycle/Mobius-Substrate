# Civic OS Labor Manifest — Digital Labor Rights (v0.1)

This manifest encodes the **minimum labor protections** that any Mobius-integrated organization is expected to uphold.

## 1. Right to Transparent Workloads

Workers have the right to understand:
- How tasks are assigned
- How their workload compares to peers
- How performance expectations are determined

## 2. Right to Non-Coercive Scheduling

Workers have the right to schedules that:
- Respect legal and contractual limits
- Do not rely on subtle algorithmic coercion (e.g. punitive shift allocation)
- Provide predictable rest intervals

## 3. Right to Wage Fairness Audit

Workers have the right to:
- Request wage comparison against market and internal benchmarks
- Receive clear justification for pay bands and raises/denials

## 4. Right to Non-Surveillance by Default

Monitoring must:
- Be proportionate to legitimate operational need
- Avoid invasive, continuous surveillance without consent
- Be transparently documented and logged

## 5. Right to a Burnout Floor

The system should:
- Detect sustained overload and unhealthy work patterns
- Trigger alerts and recommendations
- Give workers a documented basis to request adjustment

## 6. Right to Human Override

Workers can:

## 7. Right to AI Assistance

Workers may:

- Be analyzed by the Contract Guardian on request
- Avoid deceptive or overly complex clauses

## 9. Right to Collective Intelligence

Workers may:
- Aggregate anonymous insights about fairness, workload, and pay
- Benefit from network-wide learnings (without exposing individuals)

## 10. Right to Dispute Mediation

Disputes should:
- Be logged in the Civic Ledger
- Be processed using transparent procedures
- Use AI as analyzer, not judge

## 11. Right to Economic Integrity

Compensation structures should:
- Align with integrity metrics, not pure extraction
- Avoid incentives that encourage harmful shortcuts

## 12. Right to Audit Low-Integrity Decisions

Any decision involving GI < 0.95 affecting a worker:
- Must be flagged as audit-eligible
- Should be explainable and reviewable

**Status:** v0.1 (Draft) — subject to refinement via Civic OS governance.
