notes: |
  This is the Tier 0 Custodian Agent for Wikipedia, with maximum autonomy
  and capabilities. It operates under strict integrity constraints and cannot
  be overridden except by Elder Quorum supermajority (4/5 vote) or Cathedral
  Emergency Constitution (MII < 80).
  
  All spending decisions are logged on-ledger with full attestations,
  making Wikipedia's financial operations completely transparent and auditable.
