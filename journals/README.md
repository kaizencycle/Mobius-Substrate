## Cycle Journals

Cycle Journals are lightweight, auditable records for tracking progress, integrity, and meaning.

### Key Concepts

- **Source of Truth:** `journals/cycles/C-XXX.json` (schema-validated)
- **Preview:** `journals/cycles/C-XXX.md` (auto-generated for Substack)
- **Pattern:** Agents propose → Mobius Bot commits (PR-based)

### Documentation

- [Cycle Journal Runtime](../docs/CYCLE_JOURNAL_RUNTIME.md) — Full specification
- [Cycle Journal Publishing](../docs/CYCLE_JOURNAL_PUBLISHING.md) — Publishing guide
- [Schema](../schemas/cycle_journal.schema.json) — JSON schema

### Commands

```bash
# Validate all cycle journal entries
npm run cycle:validate

# Render JSON to Markdown
npm run cycle:render

# Full validation + render
npm run cycle:check
```

### Agent Prompts

- [ATLAS Prompt](../prompts/cycle_journal/ATLAS.md) — Topology mapping
