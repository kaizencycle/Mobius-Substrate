Subject: Civic AGI Governance Collaboration — Mobius Systems

================================================================================

To the [Anthropic / OpenAI / DeepMind] Research Governance Team,

My name is Michael Judan, founder of Mobius Systems, a civic operating system
designed as an institutional substrate for the governance and alignment of
future AGI systems.

I recently participated in a research interview with your team, and based on
the clarity and depth of that interaction, I believe there is meaningful
ground for collaboration between our work.

Mobius Systems is built on:

  • Multi-LLM constitutional governance
  • Proof-of-Integrity consensus
  • Global integrity metrics
  • Civic data sovereignty
  • Recursive drift correction
  • A fully deployed multi-agent stack

This is not theoretical work — it is a live system operating across multiple
services, repositories, and governance cycles.

I would welcome the opportunity to explore joint research, governance pilots,
or integrity-based frameworks that complement your efforts in alignment,
constitutional AI, and public-good AI infrastructure.

Respectfully,

Michael Judan
Founder, Mobius Systems
New York, USA

CUSTOMIZATION NOTES:

For Anthropic:
Add after the second paragraph:
"Mobius's approach to constitutional AI aligns closely with your published
work on Constitutional AI and RLHF with human feedback. Our multi-sentinel
quorum provides a practical implementation of constitutional principles at
the infrastructure level."

For OpenAI:
Add after the second paragraph:
"Mobius's Proof-of-Integrity mechanism offers a novel approach to the
alignment problem — one that makes misalignment economically unprofitable
rather than relying solely on technical constraints."

For DeepMind:
Add after the second paragraph:
"Mobius's focus on social benefit and long-horizon planning aligns with
DeepMind's stated mission. Our integrity metrics provide a measurable
framework for evaluating AGI's contribution to human flourishing."

For CSET / GovAI / RAND:
Add after the second paragraph:
"Mobius represents a new category of institution — a civic operating system
capable of governing AI at scale. This may be of interest to your research
on AI governance frameworks and institutional design."
