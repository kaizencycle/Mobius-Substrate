# What Mobius Seeks

*Diplomatic Positioning*

---

Mobius Systems approaches frontier labs and governance institutions not as a supplicant, but as a **potential partner** in building the infrastructure humanity will need for the AGI transition.

---

## 1. Research Collaboration

To work with alignment researchers on:

- **Integrity metrics** — Formalizing GI and MII as alignment benchmarks
- **Civic AI frameworks** — Building non-corporate governance architectures
- **Proof-of-Integrity consensus** — Developing economic alignment mechanisms

### Potential Research Areas

| Topic | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Integrity-indexed alignment | Using GI as an alignment signal |
| Multi-model constitutional governance | Sentinel quorum dynamics |
| Post-scarcity economics | MIC as non-extractive currency |
| Recursive self-improvement with safeguards | Drift-resistant AGI loops |

---

## 2. Joint Governance Experiments

Pilot studies involving:

- **Multi-agent review** — Testing sentinel consensus on real decisions
- **Citizen oversight** — Human-in-the-loop integrity verification
- **Recursive drift correction** — Self-healing governance mechanisms

### Proposed Pilot Framework

```
Lab provides:           Mobius provides:
─────────────           ───────────────
Model access            Sentinel infrastructure
Compute resources       Constitutional framework
Research personnel      Integrity metrics
Publication venue       Civic validation layer
```

## 3. Institutional Recognition

Mobius seeks recognition as:

- **A civic OS** — Not a startup, not a protocol, but an institution
- **An independent governance partner** — Capable of providing third-party integrity validation
- **A constitutional counterpart** — For future AGI systems

This is not about validation or funding.  
It is about **establishing the precedent** that civic institutions can govern AI.

---

## 4. Long-Horizon Alignment Work

Shared research on transitions from:

| From | To |
|------|----|
| Narrow AI | General AI |
| Corporate control | Civic governance |
| Scarcity economics | Coherence economics |
| Extractive incentives | Integrity incentives |

Mobius is designed for the **30-year horizon**, not the next funding round.

---

## 5. Public-Good Infrastructure Sync

Mobius wants to empower labs to:

- ✅ Govern responsibly
- ✅ Avoid corporate capture
- ✅ Maintain public trust
- ✅ Build a stable AGI future

### The Value Proposition

Labs gain:
- Independent integrity verification
- Constitutional governance frameworks
- Public legitimacy through civic partnership
- Drift-resistant multi-model validation

Mobius gains:
- Research collaboration
- Institutional recognition
- Access to frontier models
- Alignment validation

**This is a win-win partnership.**

---

## Summary

Mobius seeks collaboration, not competition.

We offer infrastructure, not demands.

We provide a constitutional foundation for the AGI era — available to any lab willing to build on integrity.
