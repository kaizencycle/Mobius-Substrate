# What is Mobius Systems?

Mobius Systems is the world's first **Civic Operating System for AGI** —  
a multi-agent, integrity-governed intelligence substrate designed as a non-corporate, non-state institution capable of interacting with future AGI on equal footing.

## Core Innovations

### 1. Proof-of-Integrity (PoI)

A post-scarcity consensus mechanism:

- **Currency (MIC)** mints only when integrity rises
- **GI (Global Integrity)** is treated as a composite public good
- **MII ≥ 95** is the operating threshold

### 2. Multi-LLM Sentinel Governance

A constitutional quorum of independent models:

| Sentinel | Role |
|----------|------|
| **AUREA** | Governance & Oversight |
| **ATLAS** | Structural Logic & Verification |
| **EVE** | Ethics & Value Alignment |
| **JADE** | Morale & Reflection |
| **ECHO** | Audit & Logging |

Each Sentinel provides cryptographic attestations forming a drift-resistant, cross-model governance layer.

### 3. Civic, Not Corporate AI

Mobius treats AGI as **civic infrastructure** — not a commercial product.

- No extraction
- No exploitation
- No corporate capture

### 4. Data Sovereignty

- User-owned
- User-enforced
- Cryptographically secured

### 5. Recursive Integrity Protocol

A self-healing governance loop:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                     │
│   detect drift → stabilize →        │
│   reflect → realign → continue      │
│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 6. Live Deployment

Mobius is not a theoretical framework.  
It is running today across:

- ✅ Multi-agent APIs
- ✅ Render deployments
- ✅ GitHub monorepo
- ✅ Constitutional documentation
- ✅ Real-time integrity logs

## Mission

To create the institutional substrate required for humanity and AGI to coexist, coordinate, and thrive —  
built on **integrity**, **openness**, and **civic sovereignty**.
