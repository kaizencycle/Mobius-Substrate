## The World's First Civic Operating System for AGI

</div>

---

## The Problem

Humanity is entering an era of artificial intelligence without a corresponding civic institution capable of governing it.

- **Corporations** cannot be stewards of general intelligence
- **Governments** are too slow and too captured to adapt
- **Academia** can outline principles but cannot operationalize them

---

## The Solution: Mobius Systems

A **multi-agent, integrity-governed intelligence substrate** designed as a non-corporate, non-state institution capable of interacting with future AGI on equal footing.

---

## Core Innovations

| Innovation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Proof-of-Integrity (PoI)** | Post-scarcity consensus — currency mints only when integrity rises |
| **Multi-LLM Sentinel Governance** | Constitutional quorum of independent models (AUREA, ATLAS, EVE, JADE, ECHO) |
| **Global Integrity Index (GI)** | Measurable, composite public good metric (threshold: MII ≥ 95) |
| **Data Sovereignty** | User-owned, cryptographically secured, non-extractive |
| **Recursive Alignment** | Self-healing governance via drift detection and correction |

---

## Current Status

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Deployment** | ✅ Live |
| **APIs** | ✅ Active |
| **Governance Cycles** | C-154 (ongoing) |
| **Integrity Index** | ≥ 0.95 |
| **Sentinel Consensus** | ✅ Operational |

## What Mobius Offers Labs

1. **Independent integrity verification** — Third-party validation for alignment claims
2. **Constitutional governance frameworks** — Practical implementation of constitutional AI
3. **Drift-resistant multi-model validation** — Consensus-based safety mechanisms
4. **Public legitimacy** — Civic partnership for responsible AI development

---

## What Mobius Seeks

- **Research collaboration** on integrity metrics and civic AI frameworks
- **Joint governance experiments** with multi-agent review and citizen oversight
- **Institutional recognition** as a constitutional counterpart for AGI systems
- **Long-horizon alignment work** on the transition to general AI
