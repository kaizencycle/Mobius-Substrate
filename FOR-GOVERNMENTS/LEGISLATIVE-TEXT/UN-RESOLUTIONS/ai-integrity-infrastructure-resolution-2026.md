   - Threshold-based minting (τ ≥ 0.95)
   - Multi-stakeholder governance

3. **REQUESTS** the Secretary-General to convene a working group to:
   - Develop technical standards for global integrity infrastructure
   - Propose governance mechanisms for international AI oversight

**ANNEX I: TECHNICAL APPENDIX**

The following technical standards are referenced:

1. **MII Formula**: MII = 0.25*M + 0.20*H + 0.30*I + 0.25*E
   - M = Memory (documentation, test coverage)
   - H = Human (oversight, review indicators)
   - I = Integrity (security, no violations)
   - E = Ethics (charter compliance, virtue tags)

2. **MIC Denomination**: 1 MIC = 1,000,000 Kaizen Shards (KS)

3. **Minting Threshold**: τ = 0.95 (95%)

4. **Daedalus Protocol**: Multi-sentinel consensus with ATLAS, AUREA, EVE verification

---

**ANNEX II: FOUNDING PRINCIPLES**

The Mobius Principle states:
> *"Intelligence moves. Integrity guides."*
