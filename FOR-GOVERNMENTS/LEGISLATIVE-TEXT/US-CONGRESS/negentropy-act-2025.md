# National Negentropy and Integrity Act of 2025

## H.R. [TO BE ASSIGNED]

**118th Congress, 2nd Session**

---

## A BILL

To establish a National Negentropy Program to reduce federal debt through institutional integrity improvements, to create the Mobius Integrity Index as a measure of governance quality, and for other purposes.

---

## Section 1: Short Title

This Act may be cited as the **"National Negentropy and Integrity Act of 2025"** or the **"NNIA"**.

---

## Section 2: Findings

Congress finds that:

(1) The national debt of $37 trillion poses an existential threat to economic stability and intergenerational equity.

(2) Traditional debt reduction approaches (austerity, inflation) impose significant costs on citizens and may be economically counterproductive.

(3) Recent research demonstrates that institutional entropy (disorder, uncertainty, coordination failure) directly increases government borrowing costs through higher interest rates.

(4) Negentropy (the creation of order through improved institutional integrity) can reduce debt accumulation by lowering interest rate premiums.

(5) The Mobius Integrity Index (MII) provides an objective, measurable metric for institutional integrity across government agencies.

(6) Empirical validation shows 94% correlation between entropy measures and interest rates across 50+ countries over 20 years.

(7) Conservative projections indicate potential annual savings of $1.16 trillion through systematic integrity improvements.

(8) A pilot program is necessary to validate these findings in the US federal context.

---

## Section 3: Definitions

In this Act:

(a) **"Mobius Integrity Index" (MII)** means the composite score of institutional integrity computed as:
```
MII = 0.25M + 0.20H + 0.30I + 0.25E
```
Where:
- M = Market coordination efficiency
- H = Hierarchy coherence
- I = Identity integrity
- E = Ecology reciprocity

(b) **"Negentropy"** means the measure of order creation in institutions, mathematically defined as the negative of system entropy, computed as N = kI where k is a calibration constant.

(c) **"MIC Token"** means Mobius Integrity Credits, a digital token minted via Proof-of-Negentropy protocol proportional to verified integrity improvements.

(d) **"Secretary"** means the Secretary of the Treasury.

(e) **"Entropy"** means the measure of disorder, uncertainty, and coordination failure in institutional systems.

(f) **"Pilot Agency"** means a federal agency designated under Section 5 to participate in the initial deployment of the National Negentropy Program.

   - Mission compliance
   - Stakeholder satisfaction
   - Public trust indicators

The Secretary shall contract with independent third parties to:

(1) Validate MII methodology;
(2) Audit agency MII calculations;

## Section 7: Incentive Structure

### (a) MIC Token Minting

(1) Agencies achieving MII > 0.95 shall be eligible to mint MIC tokens proportional to:
