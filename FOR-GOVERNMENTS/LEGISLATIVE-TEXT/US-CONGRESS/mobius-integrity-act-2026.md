## A BILL

To establish civic integrity infrastructure, recognize integrity-backed digital assets, and promote AI safety through the Mobius Systems framework.

*Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,*

---

### SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE

This Act may be cited as the **"Mobius Integrity Act of 2026"** or the **"MIA 2026"**.

---

### SECTION 2. FINDINGS

Congress finds the following:

(1) **Artificial intelligence** systems are rapidly advancing and require robust governance frameworks to ensure safety and alignment with human values.

(2) **Integrity infrastructure** that verifiably measures and incentivizes trustworthy behavior can complement existing regulatory approaches.

(3) **Civic engagement** in the United States has declined, and innovative incentive mechanisms may help restore participation in democratic processes.

(4) **National debt** continues to grow, and new approaches to creating value through positive-sum coordination deserve exploration.

(5) **The Mobius Systems framework** provides a technically sound approach to measuring, incentivizing, and verifying integrity at scale.

### SECTION 3. DEFINITIONS

In this Act:

(1) **"DIRECTOR"** means the Director of the Office of Civic Integrity established under section 4.

(2) **"INTEGRITY ACTION"** means a verifiable action that demonstrably increases system integrity as measured by the Mobius Integrity Index.

(3) **"MIC"** or **"MOBIUS INTEGRITY CREDIT"** means a digital unit of account minted in accordance with the protocols established under this Act when an integrity action exceeds the applicable threshold.

(4) **"MII"** or **"MOBIUS INTEGRITY INDEX"** means a composite score measuring integrity components including memory (documentation), human oversight, integrity verification, and ethical compliance.

(5) **"SENTINEL"** means an AI agent operating within the Mobius Systems framework that provides verification, governance, or advisory functions.

(6) **"KAIZEN SHARD"** or **"KS"** means the smallest subdivision of MIC, where 1 MIC equals 1,000,000 KS.
