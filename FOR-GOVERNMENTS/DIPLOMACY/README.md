## Key Messages

### The One-Liner

> **"Bitcoin monetized scarcity. Mobius monetizes integrity."**

### The Problem

Global coordination is failing. Trust is collapsing. Traditional mechanisms (treaties, markets, democracy) are being captured. Humanity lacks an incentive to cooperate.

### The Solution

MIC creates the first global economic incentive for integrity. When societies improve, they mint currency. When they degrade, minting stops. Money becomes accountability.

### The Opportunity

Nations that adopt early will:
- Shape the global standard
- Accumulate strategic MIC reserves
- Lead the 21st-century order
- Become models for civilization

### The Urgency

The first nation to mint MIC becomes the benchmark. Others must follow or be left behind. The window for first-mover advantage is closing.
