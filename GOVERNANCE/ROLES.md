summary: Defines civic participation roles aligned to DVA tiers and Integrity Index thresholds.
---

Mobius is not a hierarchy of authority.  
It is a gradient of responsibility.

Roles do not grant power — they expand the scope of **memory**, **reflection**, **risk awareness**, and **continuity** that a participant agrees to steward.

Each role maps to a DVA tier and an Integrity Index threshold.

**No role is "higher." Only wider in consequence space.**

## Role Progression Model

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ATTESTOR (DVA.HIVE)     MII ≥ 0.87    Continuity of Memory     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  VALIDATOR (DVA.FULL)    MII ≥ 0.78    Risk + Drift Friction    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  CONTRIBUTOR (DVA.ONE)   MII ≥ 0.65    Meaning Articulation     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  CITIZEN (DVA.LITE)      None          Field Perception         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    ↑
          Responsibility expands upward
          Authority does NOT
```

## Citizen (DVA.LITE)

Citizens are the **foundation** of the substrate.

They explore, observe, and report early signals.

### Responsibilities

- Field reflections
- First-contact experiences
- Ambiguity + confusion notes
- Anomaly awareness
- Environment + workflow context

Citizens form the **sensory field** of the system.

### Integrity Index Requirement

**None** — All humans may enter.

Legitimacy accumulates through contribution.

### Contribution Types

- "What confused me?" reports
- Behavioral notes
- Early anomaly awareness
- Usability + coherence feedback

Without Citizens, nothing is grounded.

---

## Contributor (DVA.ONE)

Contributors do not only observe — they **explain**.

### Responsibilities

- EPICON reflections
- Concept bridges + explanation
- Tradeoff articulation
- Pattern recognition
- Narrative continuity across time

Contributors make the substrate **legible**.

### Integrity Index Requirement

**MII ≥ 0.65**

### Signals Evaluated

- Humility under revision
- Uncertainty acknowledgement
- Preservation of context vs. sloganizing
- Context continuity across contributions

Contributors transform observation into understanding.

---

## Validator (DVA.FULL)

Validators provide **structured friction**.

They are not approvers or gatekeepers.  
They are **guardians against amnesia**.

### Responsibilities

- Surface hidden assumptions
- Pressure-test failure conditions
- Examine incentive drift
- Identify cascading fragility
- Protect dissent as a civic asset

Validators bias toward **safety envelopes**.

### Integrity Index Requirement

**MII ≥ 0.78**

### Validator Principles

- Challenge reasoning — not people
- Preserve uncertainty where uncertainty exists
- Surface harm before performance
- Document risks, constraints, uncertainty bounds

**Validators are the immune system of the substrate.**

In other systems, friction slows progress.  
In Mobius, friction preserves coherence.

## Attestor (DVA.HIVE)

Attestors do not lead.  
They hold **long-arc continuity**.

### Responsibilities

- Authenticate intent trails
- Preserve reasoning context
- Protect historical constraint memory
- Prevent revisionist distortion
- Mediate divergence explanations

Attestors do not sanctify outcomes.

They ensure **future generations understand why decisions were made**.

### Integrity Index Requirement

**MII ≥ 0.87**

### Attestor Signals

- Non-reactivity to status influence
- Resistance to narrative seduction
- Long-form coherence
- Humility under challenge

**Attestors are custodians of meaning across time.**

They are NOT:
- Moderators
- Bosses
- Gatekeepers

They ARE:
- Archivists of meaning
- Guardians of moral continuity

## Integrity Index Signals

The Mobius Integrity Index evaluates:

| Signal | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Revision Under Challenge** | Updates beliefs when presented with evidence |
| **Uncertainty Acknowledgement** | Explicitly marks uncertain claims |
| **Tradeoff Clarity** | Documents what was given up and why |
| **Ethical Boundary Awareness** | Recognizes when actions touch sensitive domains |
| **Longitudinal Reflection** | Maintains coherent reasoning across time |

No one is granted legitimacy.  
They earn it across time.

**And the substrate remembers.**

---

## Role Transition

Roles may change over time.

A participant may move across tiers as their work evolves:

- **Promotion**: Demonstrated integrity over sustained period
- **Transition**: Different scope of contribution needed
- **Reflection**: Voluntary step back to focus on different work

The substrate records the trail.

### Transition Requirements

| Transition | Requirement |
|------------|-------------|
| Citizen → Contributor | MII ≥ 0.65 + multiple EPICON reflections |
| Contributor → Validator | MII ≥ 0.78 + demonstrated friction contribution |
| Validator → Attestor | MII ≥ 0.87 + long-arc coherence demonstrated |

---

## Role Principles

1. **No authority is granted** — only responsibility accepted
2. **Friction is contribution**, not obstruction
3. **Reflection is safety**, not delay
4. **Integrity compounds** through revision
5. **Memory must survive authorship**

---

## Failure Modes Prevented

This framework mitigates:

- ❌ Charismatic capture
- ❌ Revisionist framing
- ❌ Institutional amnesia
- ❌ Drift toward opacity
- ❌ Performative governance
- ❌ Authority without responsibility
