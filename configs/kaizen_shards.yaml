# Kaizen Shard Weights — v2.0

# Reference: MIC_Whitepaper_v2.0.md Section 6.1

threshold_mii: 0.95        # τ for MIC minting

# Normalized weights (sum to 1.0) for MII composition
# These represent the relative importance of each shard type
# in contributing to Global Integrity
shard_weights_normalized:
  reflection: 0.20     # Personal growth, introspection, E.O.M.M.
  learning: 0.15       # Knowledge acquisition, skill development
  civic: 0.25          # Community contribution, governance (highest weight)
  stability: 0.15      # System reliability, uptime
  stewardship: 0.10    # Long-term care, maintenance
  innovation: 0.10     # Creative breakthroughs, R&D
  guardian: 0.05       # Security, defense

# Multiplier weights for reward scaling (legacy compatibility)
# Higher multipliers = harder to earn = higher reward per shard

# Shard-to-MIC conversion
conversion:
  rate: 0.01                # 1 MIC per 100 weighted shards
  min_shards_for_payout: 10 # Minimum shards before conversion eligible

# Weight Rationale (from whitepaper):
# - Civic (0.25): Highest weight for direct commons contribution
# - Reflection (0.20): Emphasizes continuous improvement culture
# - Learning (0.15): Encourages knowledge sharing
# - Stability (0.15): Rewards operational excellence
# - Stewardship (0.10): Values maintenance over novelty
# - Innovation (0.10): Balances new ideas with stability
# - Guardian (0.05): Recognizes security as baseline, not differentiator
