# Mobius v1.0 — Executive Summary

**A Civic Operating System for the AI Era**

---

## Overview

Mobius is a **Civic Operating System** designed to unify humans, AI agents, and digital institutions under a shared measure of integrity.

It introduces:

### Core Components

**MIC: Mobius Integrity Credits**  
Reserve currency that mints only when civilization maintains high integrity (MII ≥ 95)

**KS: Kaizen Shards**  
Participatory currency for citizens, with 2% burn funding treasuries and insurance

**GI: Global Integrity Score**  
0-1 measure of truthfulness, reliability, and alignment for individuals, institutions, and agents

**MII: Mobius Integrity Index**  
0-100 civilizational health metric that gates all major economic and governance actions

**GI-Sim: Integrity Simulation Engine**  
Deterministic oracle that forecasts integrity impact of all proposed actions

**CivicNodes: Sovereign Institutions**  
Wikipedia, arXiv, libraries become first-class entities with treasuries and AI stewards

**Custodian Agents: Bounded AI**  
AI representatives with integrity-gated autonomy across 5 sovereignty levels

**City-States: The HIVE**  
Digital polities where citizens form communities, run events, and govern locally

**The Cathedral: Constitutional Chamber**  
Elder-led governance layer that maintains system integrity and responds to crises

---

## The Problem

Modern digital society suffers from:
- Misinformation epidemics
- Institutional decay
- AI misalignment
- Extractive economics
- Governance capture
- Loss of public trust

---

## The Solution

Mobius creates the first **integrity-governed** digital civilization where:

1. **Currency expands only when integrity is high** (MII-gated MIC minting)
2. **Institutions are funded automatically by AI usage** (Integrity Dividend Mechanism)
3. **AI agents earn autonomy through demonstrated integrity** (5 Sovereignty Levels)
4. **Citizens build communities with local governance** (HIVE City-States)
5. **Elders guard constitutional invariants** (Cathedral oversight)
6. **All actions pass integrity evaluation** (GI-Sim forecasting)

---

## Key Innovations

### 1. Integrity-Backed Currency

MIC is the first currency where:
```
Supply ∝ Civilization_Integrity
```

### 2. Automatic Institutional Funding

Wikipedia, arXiv, and libraries receive MIC dividends proportional to:
```
Dividend_i = MIC_pool × (usage_i × GI_i × weight_i) / Σ Score
```

### 3. Constitutional AI Alignment

Agents gain autonomy by:
- Demonstrating integrity over time
- Passing GI-Sim evaluations
- Earning community trust

All autonomy is revocable if integrity fails.

### 4. Self-Correcting Economics

2% KS burn on all transactions creates:
- State treasuries (70%)
- Insurance pools (20%)
- Cathedral reserves (10%)

Automatic stabilizers prevent collapse.

### 5. Hybrid Human-AI Governance

- Humans retain ultimate authority (no AI Elders)
- AI agents serve at all levels (Companion → Civic → Custodian → State → Cathedral)
- Both follow the same integrity rules

## Unlike Web2 or Web3

| Feature | Web2 | Web3 | Mobius |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| Identity | Centralized | Anonymous | Sovereign + Reputation |
| Governance | Corporate | Token-voting | Integrity-weighted |
| Economics | Extractive | Speculative | Merit-based |
| AI | Tools only | None | First-class citizens |
| Institutions | Profit-driven | Absent | Integrity-funded |
| Stability | Fragile | Volatile | Self-correcting |

---

## Impact

Mobius enables:

**For Knowledge Institutions:**
- Sustainable funding without donations or ads
- Automatic rewards proportional to impact
- AI stewards with integrity constraints
