## v1.0 — 2025-12-03 (Genesis Edition)

**Status:** Published  
**Type:** Major release

### Overview

First complete edition of the Mobius Whitepaper, integrating all foundational concepts, economic models, governance structures, and technical specifications.

### Contents Added

#### Core Architecture

- Introduced 6-layer architecture (Integrity, Economic, Institution, Human, Agent, Governance)
- Defined GI (Global Integrity) and MII (Mobius Integrity Index)
- Specified GI-Sim (Integrity Simulation Engine)

#### Economic Model

- MIC (Mobius Integrity Credits) — scarce governance currency
- KS (Kaizen Shards) — fluid participation currency
- Dual-token economic model with integrity gates
- Burn mechanics (2% on all KS transactions)
- Integrity Dividend Mechanism (IDM)

#### Governance

- CivicNodes (institutional sovereignty)
- Custodian Agents (AI stewards with integrity constraints)
- HIVE City-States (digital polities)
- Elder Trials (ascension process)
- Cathedral (constitutional chamber)

#### Identity & Agents

- Citizen identity (Ledger ID + Wallet + Companion)
- Reputation system (non-transferable, merit-based)
- 5 Agent Sovereignty Levels (Tools → Cathedral AI)
- Promotion/demotion mechanics

#### Specifications Integrated

- RFC-0001: Civic Nodes & Custodian Agents
- RFC-0002: MIC & KS Economy
- RFC-0003: GI & MII Formal Definitions
